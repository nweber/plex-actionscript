Their second guitarist Yusuke Suga (須賀 勇介) left the band in 2010.&#xA;&#xA;12012 has released a total of five full-length albums. &quot;PLAY DOLLs&quot; (2006), &quot;DIAMOND&quot; (2007), &quot;mar maroon&quot; (2009), &quot;SEVEN&quot; (2010) and &quot;12012&quot; (2012).&#xA;&#xA;12012 started their activities in 2003 on the label UNDER CODE PRODUCTION. The band centers its work around the concept of &quot;Madness inside a human&quot;, and their lyricist Miyawaki is writing about madness, depression and melancholy. In 2007 they debuted on the Universal Music label NAYUTAWAVE RECORDS as a major band, and the direction was going towards the more mainstream rock with lighter lyrics and tunes. In 2011 they left the label NAYUTAWAVE RECORDS, and got signed to FIREWALL DIV. which also publishes the bands DIR EN GREY and MERRY. &#xA;&#xA;In December 2011 they revealed that they're releasing a new eponymous studio album &quot;12012&quot;. The release date was set to March 14, 2012. This is a new era of the band. After their second guitarist left the band, and their contract ending at NAYUTAWAVE RECORDS, the band are going back to their roots with aggressive tunes and explicit lyrics. A couple of days before the album release, the music video of the lead track &quot;SUICIDE&quot; was uploaded on their homepage in a censured version.&#xA;&#xA;Official homepage: http://12012.jp&#xA;   &#xA;User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL." index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/2956/thumb?t=1344380546" addedAt="1344380190" updatedAt="1344380546">

Matt Wachter later joined the band as bassist and keyboard player. After working with a number of guitarists (including Kevin Drake and Solon Bixler), the band auditioned Tomo Miličević to complete the band's official roster. After Wachter's departure from the band in 2006, the Leto brothers and Miličević continue on as a trio with additional touring members, including Tim Kelleher on bass.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;The band has released three albums.&#xA;&#xA;30 Seconds to Mars — 2002&#xA;The band's debut self-titled album, produced by Bob Ezrin, was released in 2002 to mixed reviews and achieved sales of just over 100,000[citation needed]. The album produced two singles, Capricorn (A Brand New Name) and Edge of the Earth. The former peaked at #31 on the U.S. Mainstream Rock chart.&#xA;&#xA;A Beautiful Lie — 2005&#xA;Their sophomore album, A Beautiful Lie, was released on August 30, 2005. Because the album was leaked five months before its release, the band decided to include two bonus tracks: &quot;Battle of One&quot; (an original song that was also set to be the album's title track when it was first announced) and &quot;Hunter&quot; (a cover of the Björk song). To further promote the album, the band also enclosed &quot;golden tickets&quot; in 12 copies, which granted their owners access to any 30 Seconds to Mars concert free of charge, along with backstage access.&#xA;&#xA;This Is War — 2009&#xA;This Is War was released on December 7 in the United Kingdom and December 8th in the United States. This Is War is the first studio album by 30 Seconds To Mars in four years since A Beautiful Lie released in 2005. The album will include the following tracks: &quot;Escape&quot;, &quot;Night of the Hunter&quot;, &quot;Kings and Queens&quot; , &quot;This Is War&quot;  &quot;100 Suns&quot;,  &quot;Hurricane&quot; , &quot;Closer to the Edge&quot;, &quot;Vox Populi&quot;, &quot;Search &amp; Destroy&quot;, &quot;Alibi&quot;, &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot;, &quot;L490&quot;. The first single from the album was 'Kings and Queens', and it was released on 6th October 2009.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;The Echelon&#xA;The Echelon is a publicity street team for the band 30 Seconds to Mars, which helps in bringing friends to the shows, phoning local radio stations to request the band's songs, putting up posters, posting to band forums or related bulletin boards online, voting for the band in official award nominations and maintaining magazines or websites dedicated to the band. It is also the name of one of their songs in the album 30 Seconds to Mars.&#xA;&#xA;Logo&#xA;The band's phoenix logo.The band's phoenix logo (which the band named &quot;Mithra&quot;) bears the phrase &quot;Provehito in Altum&quot;, the band's motto, roughly translated from Latin as &quot;Launch forth into the deep&quot;, but a more stylized version would be &quot;Rocket in(to) High(ness)&quot; or &quot;March The Skies&quot;. The logo was primarily used for promotion of the band's debut, whereas for A Beautiful Lie, the new Trinity logo was created consisting of three skulls, along with the band's name and motto. For This Is War, the band has adopted the alchemical symbol for air, continuing on the sky/air theme.&#xA;&#xA;Band members&#xA;Jared Leto – lead vocals, Rhythm guitar, Keyboard, lyrics (1998–present) &#xA;Shannon Leto – drums, Percussion (1998–present)&#xA;Tomo Miličević – lead guitar, Violin, Keyboard/synth, programming (2003–present)&#xA;   &#xA;User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL." index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/2959/thumb?t=1344380558" art="/library/metadata/2959/art?t=1344380558" addedAt="1344380191" updatedAt="1344380558">

The song propelled to the top of the charts and sent Anna on a nearly four year tour around the world. Featuring her third hit single “Shine,” Anna and SonyMusic released “The Shine EP.” Both “Wreck of the Day” and “The Shine EP” can still be heard widely on radio and television today, with “Breathe” being featured twice on the hit television drama “Grey’s Anatomy.”&#xA;&#xA;Wanting to pursue a musical style free of label influence, Anna decided to part ways with SonyMusic in 2010 and in 2011, released her first independently produced album: “Broken Doll &amp; Odds &amp; Ends.” Anna describes the album as: “mostly acoustic with haunting and unusual instrumentation. I wanted to release the songs I wrote while I was with Sony before I move on to all new material. I liked the songs too much to just leave them all behind. Now I’m ready to explore new territory.”&#xA;&#xA;Utilizing the unique sounds of toy piano, sitar, glockenspiel, oud, mandocello and sweeping string arrangements, “Broken Doll &amp; Odds &amp; Ends” features a wide range of instruments, performed by a very talented collection of musicians. Anna’s unique storytelling ability and timeless sense of melody has gained even more notoriety with fans, selling over 30,000 copies during the album’s first month.&#xA;&#xA;Presently, Anna is dedicating the majority of her time to writing for her next project.

The group managed to top the UK Singles Chart with their first three singles. The group released two albums: Aquarium in 1997 and Aquarius in 2000, before splitting up in July 2001. The group sold an estimated 33 million albums and singles, making them the most successful Danish band ever and the second most successful Norwegian band.&#xA;&#xA;In their prime, Aqua's singles managed to chart top ten in a number of countries where European pop acts would not normally succeed, including the United States, Australia, and Japan. The group also caused controversy with the double entendres in their Barbie Girl single, with the Barbie doll makers Mattel filing a lawsuit against the group. The lawsuit was finally dismissed by a judge in 2002, who ruled &quot;The parties are advised to chill&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;The band's members are vocalists Lene Nystrøm Rasted (from Norway) and Rene Dif, keyboardist Søren Rasted, and guitarist Claus Norreen.

The group is currently composed of will.i.am, Taboo, Fergie and Apl.de.ap. Since their breakout album Elephunk in 2003, they have seen international fame for their pop/dance-oriented style of hip hop music. Black Eyed Peas have so-far sold an estimated 56 million albums and singles to date worldwide, and still counting.&#xA;&#xA;Black Eyed Peas went to centenary state high school and got their start in 1988 when will.i.am (born 1975 William James Adams Jr.) and apl.de.ap (born 1974 Allan Pineda) began rapping and performing together around Los Angeles. The pair signed to Ruthless Records (run by Eazy-E) after catching the attention of the nephew of Jerry Heller (Eazy-E's manager). Along with Mookie Mook (Burning Star), Dante Santiago &amp; DJ Motiv8, they called their group A.T.B.A.N. Klann. Their debut album, Grass Roots, was not released originally because Ruthless did not consider the social themes reflected in the group's music to be marketable to their audience. A single &quot;Puddles of H2O&quot; was released in 1994 but no album was released until it leaked onto the Internet in the mid 2000s. &#xA;&#xA;After Eazy-E died of AIDS in 1995, They changed their name to Black Eyed Peas; will.i.am explained on the front cover of the Monkey Business album that &quot;Black Eyed Peas are food for the soul&quot;, hence the name. will.i.am has cited the Red Hot Chili Peppers as an influence and said he named his band after a food, like them. They replaced their original third member Mookie, with Dante Santiago the Peas original singer. Then Taboo (born Jaime Gomez) joined the group. Dante Santiago took on a role as a guest vocalist in the band and featured frequently on various tracks for their first four albums. &#xA;&#xA;In 1996, they produced and appeared on a song entitled &quot;That's Right&quot; for Brian Austin Green's hip-hop album One Stop Carnival. Later, they began using Kim Hill as a steady background singer. Unlike many hip-hop acts, they chose to perform with a live band and adopted a musical and clothing style that differed wildly from the &quot;gangsta rap&quot; sounds of other Los Angeles-based hip-hop acts at the time. Through the mid-'90s, they performed in the local club circuit alongside fellow acts such as Ozomatli and Jurassic 5.&#xA;&#xA;The group were signed to Interscope Records and released their debut, &quot;Behind the Front&quot;, in 1998. The album won the group (and their accompanying live band, the Bucky Jonsons) critical acclaim. The album featured the single &quot;Joints &amp; Jams&quot;, which was included on the Bulworth soundtrack. Their second album, &quot;Bridging the Gap&quot;, was released in 2000; it featured the single &quot;Request + Line&quot; featuring Macy Gray.&#xA;&#xA;After replacing their female background singer with Fergie, the group released their breakout album, &quot;Elephunk&quot;, and their 2005 album, &quot;Monkey Business&quot;, which featured the hit singles &quot;Pump It&quot;, &quot;Don't Phunk With My Heart&quot;, &quot;Don't Lie&quot; and &quot;My Humps&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;The E.N.D.

			<Directory ratingKey="2930" key="/library/metadata/2930/children" type="artist" title="Black Lab" summary="In 1998, Paul Durham and his rock band, Black Lab, released their Geffen Records debut Your Body Above Me to critical acclaim. The album yielded the top 10 rock and alternative single &quot;Wash it Away,&quot; and the top 40 ac and pop track &quot;Time Ago.&quot;&#xA;&#xA;Paul Durham grew up in Twin Falls, Idaho before moving to San Francisco to pursue his passion for musical invention. He recorded and toured with a group of friends under the moniker “Durham,” and made an acoustic-based singer/songwriter record with celebrated jazz producer Lee Townsend. (now available at blacklabworld.com under the title Ten Million Years: songs from the nineteen nineties). &#xA;&#xA;“Durham” split, but a deal with Geffen Records followed, a new band was built, and Black Lab's debut was tagged as &quot;one of this year's breakout records&quot; (Billboard). Hollywood called, and the band contributed songs to the soundtracks for Can't Hardly Wait, Varsity Blues, Permanent Midnight, and Buffy the Vampire Slayer. After a year of touring, Black Lab was poised to fulfill their destiny as &quot;the American U2&quot; (San Francisco Chronicle) when their record label was quickly shuttered. Over the next two years, Durham left his band, fired his manager and moved to LA. &quot;In the end, all I had were my guitars and the songs I was writing.&quot; Durham wanted to control the sound around his voice, so he bought a computer and learned to use it. &quot;I had to get back to how it was in high school -- just me and my four-track.&quot;&#xA;&#xA;The resulting demos got Durham a new deal with Epic Records. &quot;The first thing I did was buy a giant ProTools system.&quot; The only problem was, he didn't know how to install the software. On advice from a friend, Durham hired Andy Ellis to set up his studio. &quot;So, we're sitting around waiting for the computer to reboot,&quot; remembers Durham, &quot;And this guy picks up my guitar, without asking. I was cringing inside, afraid of what he would play. But he was great. I wanted to sing over the top of everything he played. Pretty soon, we were writing together.&quot;&#xA;&#xA;At 23, Ellis was already an accomplished guitarist, keyboard player and programmer. He had been working as an assistant to some of the best engineers in the business and knew how to twiddle some serious knobs. Durham had found the missing link between what he heard in his head and what came out of the speakers. &quot;Working with Andy is the first time collaboration has ever been easy,&quot; says Durham. &quot;Instead of the whole hell-is-other-people thing, we have a blast just making sounds.&#xA;&#xA;See the Sun has a depth and emotional range that broadens with each listen. Much of the album was mixed by Tom Lord-Alge (Live, Blink 182, Avril Lavigne). What shines brightest is the band's pop sensibility – the liquid swirl of &quot;Remember,&quot; the epic sweep of &quot;See the Sun,&quot; the raging loss of &quot;Without You,&quot; and the open-armed surrender of &quot;Lonely Boy.&quot; &#xA;&#xA;“Learn to Crawl” was tapped as the fourth track on the platinum Spider-Man soundtrack. Produced by Durham and veteran mixer/producer Tom Lord-Alge, the song wraps an aggressive guitar riff around what Rolling Stone calls &quot;Black Lab's tightly spun, highly melodic rock.&quot;&#xA;&#xA;The title of &quot;Ecstasy,&quot; a pulsing shadow that wakes to full rock glory, was inspired by Durham's experience recording: &quot;The freedom to do what I wanted – in the studio across the hall from my bedroom – was amazing. I would get up late, go to the beach, then work until four or five in the morning. I got to record this album the same way I wrote it.&quot; &#xA;&#xA;While See the Sun represents a zenith in Black Lab’s songwriting and production, the band continues to push and expand its sound into uncharted territory, contributing a vicious techno track called “This Blood” to the worldwide hit movie Blade : Trinity. Black Lab also continues to produce music for television (MTV’s Real World, “What I Like About You,” “The Days”) as well as the upcoming film Lovewrecked.&#xA;&#xA;The third Black Lab album, entitled &quot;Passion Leaves A Trace&quot; was released on January 16th, 2007.  Highlights include the majestic &quot;Mine Again&quot;, the jet-black remorse of &quot;This Night&quot; (featured in the trailer for The Shield Season 6, and on the episode &quot;Out of the Chute&quot; of House), the hook-laden driving force that is &quot;The Real You&quot;, and the achingly beautiful &quot;Ghost In Your Mind&quot;.  &#xA;&#xA;All things Black Lab, including streaming and free downloads from the new and past albums, can be found at blacklabworld.com. &#xA;&#xA;   &#xA;User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL." index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/2930/thumb?t=1344380580" addedAt="1344380190" updatedAt="1344380580">

They formed in 2002 when final fantasy composer Nobuo Uematsu (植松伸夫)  (keyboards, compo) decided, having heard and enjoyed rock arrangements of some of his Final Fantasy themes by 福井健一郎 (on keyboards and guitar, Kenichiro Fukui) and 関戸剛 (on lead guitar, Tsuyoshi Sekito), to form a band to showcase these arrangements. The other members include 河盛慶次 (on bass, Keiji Kawamori), 羽入田新 (on drums, Arata Hanyuuda), and 岡宮道生 (on guitar, Michio Okamiya).&#xA;&#xA;The band revised some of Uematsu's most popular fighting themes from the games of the Final Fantasy line in order to publish them in newly-arranged shape on the album The Black Mages: Battle Music of Final Fantasy. The Black Mages' overall style is a complex hybrid of progressive rock and neo-classical power metal. The songs on the first album are all instrumental and all arrangements of battle themes. The Black Mages' second album, entitled The Skies Above, was released in Japan on December 22, 2004. This album features guest vocalists on two tracks and features arrangements of a few tracks that were not originally battle themes, but the majority of tracks are still instrumental arrangements of battle themes.&#xA;&#xA;The Black Mages performed live at Shibuya-AX, April 26-27, 2003. The performance was released on DVD exclusively to fanclub members residing in Japan. The performance marked the debut of the later released &quot;Matoya's Cave&quot; and featured additional solos within songs. During the introduction of band members, Michio Okamiya performed a rendition of the Chocobo Theme and Nobuo Uematsu performed the intro to Deep Purple's &quot;Smoke On The Water&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;The Black Mages released their third album, &quot;The Black Mages III: Darkness And Starlight&quot; on March 19th, 2008. The Black Mages themselves sing the chorus for the song &quot;Darkness and Starlight&quot;, a new, extended arrangement of the opera &quot;The Dream Oath: Maria and Draco&quot; from Final Fantasy VI.&#xA;&#xA;They disbanded in 2010.&#xA;   &#xA;User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL." index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/5181/thumb?t=1344380594" addedAt="1344380468" updatedAt="1344380594">

			<Directory ratingKey="3066" key="/library/metadata/3066/children" type="artist" title="Blondie" summary="Blondie is perhaps the most commercially successful band to emerge from the 1970s punk scene. They formed in New York in 1974. The original lineup consisted of Deborah Harry (vocals), Clem Burke (drums / percussion), Jimmy Destri (keyboards), Chris Stein (guitar / bass guitar) and Gary Valentine (bass guitar / guitar).&#xA;&#xA;Blondie released their first album Blondie in 1976. The album was mildly successful and spawned the Australian hit single &quot;In The Flesh&quot;.&#xA;Gary Valentine left the band later that year, and they continued briefly as a foursome, recording Plastic Letters which contained the hit &quot;Denis&quot;. &#xA;&#xA;They added Los Angeles-based musician Frank Infante (guitar / bass guitar) in 1977 who replaced Gary Valentine. Infante had already played guitar on one track on Plastic Letters. The band went out playing live with Infante and Stein swopping between playing guitar and bass guitar through out each concert. They then also added British born but LA-based Nigel Harrison (bass guitar), making Blondie a six piece for the first time. Harrison was a former member of the glam band Silverhead.&#xA;&#xA;In 1978 they released the album that would make them international stars, Parallel Lines. The album spawned several hit singles, including the number one hit &quot;Heart Of Glass&quot;, &quot;Sunday Girl&quot;, &quot;Hanging On The Telephone&quot; and &quot;One Way Or Another&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;They released three more albums (1979's Eat To The Beat, 1980's Autoamerican (containing the number one singles &quot;The Tide Is High&quot; and &quot;Rapture&quot;) and 1982's The Hunter) and a number one single &quot;Call Me&quot; in 1980.&#xA;&#xA;In 1980, Harrison contributed several unused Blondie songs to ex-Silverhead singer Michael Des Barres solo album I'm Only Human. In 1981, Harry released a solo album Koo Koo, Destri released a solo album Heart on a Wall. Burke recorded and played live with Eurythmics, and Stein started a record label named Animal Records.&#xA;&#xA;In 1982, health problems, declining sales and inter-band tension caused the band to split. Harry kept a low profile for a few years while she nursed (now former) boyfriend Stein through a serious illness, but then continued a solo career as an actress/singer.&#xA;&#xA;Reformation plans begun in 1996 with a line-up that included Harry, Stein, Destri, Burke, Valentine, and Harrison. Infante was not invited to the reunion. Valentine and Harrison were eventually (and unceremoniously, they claim) replaced by Paul Carbonara (guitar) and Leigh Foxx (bass).&#xA;&#xA;The band released No Exit in 1998, which did quite well in both US and UK charts and contained the number one hit single &quot;Maria&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;The album did not include any song contributions from Valentine or Harrison, despite them recording early sessions for the album and Valentine being assured by Stein that they would use his already recorded song &quot;Amor Fati&quot;. Harrison and Infante later filed an unsuccessful lawsuit claiming breach of contract for not including them in the reunion.&#xA;&#xA;The Curse Of Blondie was released in 2003 and, while not matching its predecessor in sales, was critically acclaimed and spawned the global dance hit &quot;Good Boys&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;Destri retired from touring in 2004, but is still listed as a band member on their official web site. Kevin Patrick (keyboards), Destri's former keyboard tech and assistant, replaced him soon followed by Matt Katz-Bohen in 2008. &#xA;&#xA;The band's 2006 induction ceremony into the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame was the scene of an awkward moment between Infante and Harry, during which he asked that the former members be allowed to play along with fellow inductees Harry, Stein and Burke during the band's set, since it was the original band that was being inducted. Harry replied &quot;Can't you see my band is up there?&quot; prompting Infante to counter &quot;I thought it was Blondie that was being inducted.&quot;&#xA;&#xA;In 2006, the band toured as the opening act for The New Cars on the &quot;Road Rage Tour.&quot; Although Harry was more than 60 years old, the band still managed incendiary versions of their old hits, while playing with enough fire to remind the audience of their punk roots.&#xA;&#xA;In 2007, the band embarked on a tour of Europe, to coincide with the DVD release of the first ever music video album &quot;Eat To The Beat&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;Harry has since resumed her solo career, releasing 2007's Necessary Evil.  &#xA;&#xA;On June 5, 2008, Blondie commenced a world tour to celebrate the 30th anniversary of Parallel Lines with a concert at Ram's Head Live in Baltimore, Maryland. The tour covered some Eastern and Midwestern US cities throughout the month of June. In July, the tour took the band overseas to Israel, the UK, Russia, Europe and Scandinavia, wrapping up on August 2, 2008 at Rockefeller in Oslo, Norway.&#xA;&#xA;Clem Burke and Paul Carbonara both recently told interviewers that the band is working on another record, which would be their first new album since the release of The Curse of Blondie in 2003. Carbonara described it as &quot;a real Blondie record.&#xA;&#xA;Blondie undertook a North American tour of mid-sized venues with Pat Benatar and The Donnas in the summer of 2009. Following the tour, in October, the band began recording sessions for their ninth studio album with producer Jeff Saltzman in Woodstock, New York.  In December 2009, the band released the song &quot;We Three Kings&quot; to coincide with the Christmas holiday. &#xA;&#xA;The new album, to be titled Panic of Girls, which was being mixed at the time, was said to follow in 2010. Chris Stein stated that Dutch artist Chris Berens will provide the cover art. In April 2010, it was announced that guitarist Paul Carbonara had amicably left Blondie to pursue other projects and was replaced by Tommy Kessler. Panic of Girls is tentatively set to be released in 2010/2011.&#xA;&#xA;In June 2010, Blondie began the first leg of a world tour named &quot;Endangered Species Tour&quot;, which covered the United Kingdom and Ireland, supported by UK band Little Fish. The set lists featured both classics and new material from the forthcoming Panic of Girls. After a break in July the tour will resume in August and cover the United States and Canada over a course of six weeks. Blondie is then set to take the &quot;Endangered Species Tour&quot; to Australia and New Zealand in November and December. It was revealed that the bands album will be released on the Australian Sony label in November 2010, and elsewhere in January 2011.&#xA;&#xA;Songfacts reports that Mother, the first single from Panic of Girls received its global premiere on BBC Radio on March 17th, 2011 and was made available for purchase on May 23, 2011.&#xA;   &#xA;User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL." index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/3066/thumb?t=1344380605" art="/library/metadata/3066/art?t=1344380605" addedAt="1344380204" updatedAt="1344380605">

			<Directory ratingKey="2933" key="/library/metadata/2933/children" type="artist" title="Bright Eyes" summary="Bright Eyes is a band consisting mainly of American singer, guitarist, and songwriter Conor Oberst. Bright Eyes also features multi-instrumentalist/producer Mike Mogis, keyboard player Nate Walcott and a rotating lineup of collaborators drawn primarily from Omaha, Nebraska, and the United States' indie music scene.  Having been deeply influenced early on by singer-songwriters David Dondero and Simon Joyner, Conor Oberst has been recording music since the age of 13. He released his first three albums at the ages of 13, 14, 15, respectively, all under the name &quot;Conor Oberst&quot; and released only on cassettes.  He then moved onwards with a band called Commander Venus with whom he released two albums. After the break-up of this band in 1997, Conor's main focus became Bright Eyes, and in 1998 he released the first Bright Eyes album, A Collection of Songs Written and Recorded 1995-1997(a collection of 20 stockpiled songs) on the independent label saddle creek Records, which he had co-formed earlier  in collaboration with fellow local Omaha musicians. &#xA;&#xA;Saddle Creek also released Letting Off the Happiness in November 1998, a ten-track record that boasted a much more focused and clear sound than the previous album. According to the Saddle Creek press release, it features members of Lullaby for the Working Class, Neutral Milk Hotel, and of Montreal. It was predominantly recorded in the Oberst family basement in Omaha on an analog eight track reel to reel; with some work also done at keyboardist Andy Lemaster's Athens, GA studio. Although almost all of the tracks feature a full band, June On The West Coast is performed with only acoustic guitar and vocals. Padraic My Prince gives a dramatic fictional account of the death of Oberst's imagined baby brother. &#xA;&#xA;In 2000 Bright Eyes released Fevers and Mirrors, a demonstration of the immense improvement in production quality and musical vision of the band. New instruments such as flute, piano, and accordion were introduced into the song arrangements. After An Attempt To Tip The Scales, a mock radio interview takes place. The mock radio interview features Todd Fink of The Faint doing an impression of Conor Oberst while reading a script that Oberst wrote. The man interviewing is Matt Silcock, a former member of Lullaby for the Working Class. In this interview, the fake Oberst intentionally presents a strange, contradictory explanation of his attitude towards his music. The interview acknowledges criticisms of his lyrics as overblown and insincere, which had begun to appear as the popularity of the band increased, but responds by stating that the lyrics are meant for personal interpretation. In a 'real' interview with KittyMagik.com, Oberst stated about the mock one: &quot;It was a way to make fun of ourselves because the record is such a downer. I mean, that's one part of who I am, but I also like laughing and fucking around.&quot;&#xA;&#xA;2002 saw the release of Lifted or The Story Is in the Soil, Keep Your Ear to the Ground, and since then Oberst has released an almost constant stream of new material on collaborative EPs, split singles, tribute albums, and charity records. He ventured into the studio with Nebraska folk-pop outfit Tilly and the Wall, co-producing their debut album Wild Like Children and released it on his newly established record label, Team Love.&#xA;&#xA;January 2005 saw the release of two albums: I'm Wide Awake, It's Morning, which is a country-tinged mélange of Conor’s finest acoustic songs, featuring guest vocal appearances from Emmylou Harris and Jim James of My Morning Jacket; and Digital Ash in a Digital Urn, which is a more produced, electronic album featuring cameo appearances by Nick Zinner of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs. &#xA;One single from each album, Take It Easy (Love Nothing) from Digital Ash and Lua from I'm Wide Awake took the top two slots on Billboard Hot 100 Singles Chart, the first time for any artist since 1997.&#xA;As had become expected of Bright Eyes recordings, the albums feature an array of talented comrades including members of Rilo Kiley, Tilly and the Wall, Cursive, now its overhead, The Good Life, Azure Ray, The Faint, The Bruces, Neva Dinova, The Postal Service and Audrye Sessions.&#xA;&#xA;In October 2006, Bright Eyes released a compilation of rare tracks called Noise Floor: Rarities 1998-2005.&#xA;&#xA;Bright Eyes released their sixth studio album called Cassadaga on April 9, 2007, preceded by an EP entitled Four Winds on March 6, 2007.&#xA;A further 25-30 tracks have been recorded in Portland, Oregon and New York City, with another session planned in Omaha, Nebraska. Some of these tracks had already been performed at live shows.&#xA;&#xA;On February 15, 2011, the band released their seventh studio album, The People's Key.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;- - - - -&#xA;TRIVIA&#xA;A few of Oberst's songs find their roots in classic literature, such as Tereza and Tomas (a reference to Milan Kundera's The Unbearable Lightness of Being) and Neely O'Hara (Valley of the Dolls).&#xA;&#xA;List of bands featuring Conor Oberst:&#xA;Bright Eyes (1995-present)&#xA;Commander Venus (1995-97)&#xA;The Magnetas (1996)&#xA;Park Ave. (1996-98)&#xA;Desaparecidos (2000-01)&#xA;Conor Oberst and the Mystic Valley Band (2007-present)&#xA;Monsters of Folk (2009-present)&#xA;   &#xA;User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL." index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/2933/thumb?t=1344380603" art="/library/metadata/2933/art?t=1344380603" addedAt="1344380190" updatedAt="1344380603">

The group released their debut album,  While The City Sleeps, We Rule The Streets in 2006, which they followed with &amp;iexcl;Viva La Cobra! in 2007. They then released Hot Mess in 2009.

During this time, Saporta went on a &quot;vision quest&quot;, spending time with Native American tribes and smoking peyote. He began to create his vision for a new band, a melodic style of music heavily influenced by synthpop and hip-hop. Upon returning home, Saporta rented a house in the Catskill Mountains and began writing what would become the band's debut album, While The City Sleeps, We Rule The Streets. He posted a parody response to Gwen Stefani's &quot;Hollaback Girl&quot; titled &quot;Hollaback Boy&quot; on Myspace. The song gained Saporta notoriety on the internet and he eventually signed to Fall Out Boy bassist Pete Wentz's label, Decaydance Records.&#xA;Midtown's management company soon set Saporta up with an opportunity to record a song for the soundtrack to the 2006 Snakes on a Plane. Along with members of The Academy Is..., Gym Class Heroes, and The Sounds, Saporta recorded &quot;Snakes On A Plane (Bring It)&quot;, which became a minor hit. During the recording of While The City Sleeps, We Rule The Streets, Saporta began recruiting new members to complete the group's lineup. He first enlisted drummer Nate Navarro, whom he met on tour while Navarro sold merchandise for fellow touring act Hidden In Plain View. After seeing Saporta in Entertainment Weekly, guitarist Ryland Blackinton and bassist Alex Suarez, who lived in the same apartment building as Midtown drummer Rob Hitt, emailed Saporta asking to join the group.

It was produced by Patrick Stump, who was also credited as singing some backup vocals.&#xA;The album has been toured heavily worldwide. Cobra headlined the Really Really Ridiculously Good Looking Tour with guests Metro Station, The Cab, and We The Kings from January to March, 2008. They also played on Warped Tour 2008 and headlined the SassyBack tour, which toured from October 7 through November 30, 2008, with guests Forever The Sickest Kids, Hit The Lights, and Sing It Loud.&#xA;The album art for the &amp;iexcl;Viva La Cobra! album was used to promote the fourth generation Apple iPod nano in purple.&#xA;&#xA;Hot Mess (2009–2010)&#xA;Following the success of Katy Perry's &quot;I Kissed a Girl&quot;, Cobra Starship recorded their own cover version, &quot;I Kissed A Boy&quot;, in summer 2008. The song was released on August 25, 2008, on Fall Out Boy's Citizens For Our Betterment mixtape Welcome To The New Administration. Cobra Starship is one of 9 artists who participated in thetruth.com’s Remix Project, where they remixed the Sunny Side song &quot;Magical Amount&quot;.&#xA;Cobra Starship also began the Believers Never Die Tour Part Deux tour in the beginning of April, opening for Fall Out Boy, with other bands All Time Low, Metro Station, and Hey Monday. They spent time performing many shows in the US mostly all in April and the beginning of May, however they also played a few shows in the UK at the end of May 2009, supported by Sing It Loud, Cash Cash, and UK band Mimi Soya.&#xA;In 2009, the band went to a cabin in Pennsylvania, in an attempt to produce new material. They broadcasted live throughout their stay on the live camera feed site Stickam, thus creating the Shelf Kids. After their stay, a new album was announced with a tentative release in the summer. The band worked with Kara DioGuardi, Kevin Rudolf, KarateE! Mouse, S*A*M, Sluggo, and song-writers Benny Blanco and Patrick Stump on Hot Mess. Gossip Girl star Leighton Meester is featured on the song &quot;Good Girls Go Bad (feat. Leighton Meester)&quot;, which is produced by Kevin Rudolf and co-written by Rudolf and Kara DioGuardi.The song is the album's first single, and was added on iTunes on May 11 and available to listen to on the band's official MySpace page. Other songs include &quot;Pete Wentz Is the Only Reason We're Famous&quot;, which has been released on their YouTube channel and Vevo page. On May 8, the album title was confirmed as Hot Mess, with a release date of August 11. It debuted on the US Billboard 200 at number four, becoming the band's highest charting album. Guitarist Ryland Blackinton said of Hot Mess, &quot;We just wanted to make music that was fun and kinda make people just forget about whatever shitty problem they might be having during the week.&quot;&#xA;The band began its tour to promote the new album on August 3. The tour, called Hot Mess Across The US Tour, has 21 stops and features guests such as Friday Night Boys and DJ Skeet Skeet. After The plasticines dropped off the tour, Cobra Starship listed a number of candidate bands for the fans to vote for online in a blog; The Audition won. On their official video podcast (CobraCam.tv), the band released humorous tentative titles for the album (which parodies several other notable albums) &quot;Griller&quot;, &quot;Tha Ryland III&quot;, and variations of their &amp;iexcl;Viva La Cobra! album.&#xA;They made a stop on the Warped Tour in 2009, playing in Salt Lake City, on August 8, 2009. In Fall 2009, they were signed on to Boys Like Girls' &quot;Love Drunk Tour&quot; along with The Maine and A Rocket To The Moon.&#xA;Cobra Starship played at a September 11, 2009 MTV Video Music Awards weekend competition and pre-party at The Fillmore at Irving Plaza. The competition was for The MTV &quot;VMA Best Breakout New York City Artist Award&quot;, and took place before MTV Video Music Awards performers and in between performances from MTV Video Music Awards artists.&#xA;On October 13, 2009, the band performed on Jimmy Kimmel's outdoor stage.&#xA;Cobra Starship appeared at &quot;Los Premios MTV Latinoamérica 2009&quot; along with Mexican star Paulina Rubio performing &quot;Good Girls Go Bad (feat. Leighton Meester)&quot; and &quot;Ni Rosas Ni Juguetes[/track]&quot;. Cobra Starship and Paulina won an MTV Award for &quot;Best Performance&quot;, for &quot;Good Girls Go Bad (feat. Leighton Meester)&quot; and &quot;[album artist=Paulina Rubio]Ni Rosas Ni Juguetes[/track]&quot; at the Los Premios MTV Latinoamérica 2009, voted by the public, beating other artist such as Shakira, Nelly Furtado, and Wisin y Yandel.&#xA;On February 4, 2010, Cobra Starship embarked on their first ever European tour named 'Hot Mess Across The EU-Niverse', which included the UK, Ireland, Germany, France and the Netherlands. When the tour ended on February 21, the band then travelled to Japan for a few shows, then onto Australia and New Zealand for the 'Wet Hot Australian Summer' Tour. The group also toured in Germany with I Heart Sharks and One Night Stand!.&#xA;On February 5, 2010 it was announced that Cobra Starship and 3OH!3 would be embarking on a co-headlining tour called The Too Fast For Love Tour with opening acts Travis McCoy, The Lazarus Project and I Fight Dragons. The tour ran from April 28 in Milwaukee, WI, until June 13 in Asbury Park, NJ.&#xA;In November 2010, Cobra Starship played in Argentina (November 20) and São Paulo, Brazil (November 21). The latter as a part of the Yes! Rock Fest, which also promotes a variety Brazilian bands.&#xA;Along 2010 the band collaborated with the UK singer Alexandra Burke in one of the songs of her debut album's Deluxe Edition, &quot;[album artist=Alexandra Burke]Overcome&quot;. The song is called &quot;What Happens On The Dancefloor&quot;, and keeps the vibe of their previous single &quot;Good Girls Go Bad (feat. Leighton Meester)&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;Night Shades (2010–present)&#xA;Cobra Starship cancelled their 2011 Australian tour to finish up their fourth album, which they have been working on with Ryan Tedder and Kara DioGuardi. Gabe Saporta released a song off of the album, &quot;Don't Blame The World, It's the DJ's Fault&quot;, on his Tumblr. A video was released of an eggplant with sunglasses and headphones getting made into eggplant Parmesan. The video is supposed to represent the album title. Gabe later announced via Twitter that the new album will be called  Night Shades. The first single, &quot; [Track artist=Cobra Starship]You Make Me Feel...[/Track]&quot;, was released on May 10, 2011. The song features American singer/songwriter and rapper Sabi. The music video premiered on Tuesday, June 28 on MTV. The band's official Twitter and Tumblr announced that the album will be out on August 30, 2011.&#xA;Cobra Starship has recently contributed a cover of Buddy Holly's &quot;Peggy sue&quot; for the Buddy Holly tribute album, [Album artist=Buddy Holly]Listen to Me: Buddy Holly (2011)[/Album].&#xA;On September 9th 2011, Cobra Starship will be headlining the Fueled By Ramen 15th Anniversary show in New York's Terminal 5, with VersaEmerge, The Academy Is... and A Rocket To The Moon in support.&#xA;Night Shades was released on August 29, 2011 with the lead single &quot;You Make Me Feel...&quot; and also the three promotional singles.

			<Directory ratingKey="3264" key="/library/metadata/3264/children" type="artist" title="Daft Punk" summary="Daft Punk is a multi Grammy Award-winning electronic music duo formed in 1994 in Paris, France, and consisting of French musicians Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo (born 8 February 1974) and Thomas Bangalter (born 3 January 1975). The band is considered one of the most successful electronic music collaborations of all time, both in album sales and in critical acclaim. &#xA;&#xA;Daft Punk reached significant popularity in the late 90s house movement in France, along with other artists such as Air, Cassius, and Dimitri from Paris. Daft Punk are credited with producing songs that were considered essential in the French house scene. They were managed from 1996 to 2008 by Pedro Winter (Busy P), the head of Ed Banger Records.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Early years (1987–1993)&#xA;&#xA;Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo met in 1987 on the grounds of the Lycée Carnot, a secondary school in Paris. The two became good friends and later recorded demo tracks with others from the school. This eventually led to the formation of the guitar-based group Darlin' with Laurent Brancowitz in 1992. Bangalter and de Homem-Christo played bass and guitar, respectively, while Brancowitz performed on drums. The trio had branded themselves after The Beach Boys song of the same name, which they covered along with an original composition. &#xA;&#xA;Stereolab released both tracks on a multi-artist Duophonic Records EP and invited the band to open for stage shows in the United Kingdom. Bangalter felt that &quot;The rock n' roll thing we did was pretty average, I think. It was so brief, maybe six months, four songs and two gigs and that was it.&quot; A negative review in Melody Maker subsequently dubbed the music &quot;a bunch of daft punk.&quot; Instead of dismissing the review, Bangalter and de Homem-Christo found it to be amusing. As the latter stated, &quot;We struggled so long to find [the name] Darlin', and this happened so quickly.&quot; Darlin' soon disbanded, leaving Brancowitz to pursue other efforts with Phoenix. Bangalter and de Homem-Christo formed Daft Punk and experimented with drum machines and synthesizers.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Homework era (1993–1999)&#xA;&#xA;In 1993 Daft Punk attended a rave at EuroDisney, where they met Stuart Macmillan of Slam, co-founder of the label Soma Quality Recordings. The demo tape given to Macmillan at the rave formed the basis for Daft Punk's debut single, &quot;The New Wave&quot;, a limited release in 1994. The single also contained the final mix of &quot;The New Wave&quot; called &quot;Alive&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;Daft Punk returned to the studio in May 1995 to record &quot;Da Funk&quot;. It became their first commercially successful single the same year. After the success of &quot;Da Funk&quot;, Daft Punk looked to find a manager. They had no trouble finding one at the time as they chose Pedro Winter, who regularly promoted them and other artists at his Hype night clubs. The band signed with Virgin Records in September 1996 and made a deal through which they licensed their tracks to the major label through their production company, Daft Trax.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Da Funk&quot; and &quot;Alive&quot; were later included on Daft Punk's 1997 debut album Homework. The album was regarded as an innovative synthesis of techno, house, acid house and electro styles, and is widely acknowledged as one of the most influential dance music albums of the nineties. &quot;Da Funk&quot; was also included on The Saint film soundtrack. It was during this period of change in dance music that Daft Punk became largely successful. They combined the aforementioned music styles and elements of rave that were crowd pleasers. The most successful single from Homework was &quot;Around the World&quot;, which is known for the repeating chant of the song's title.&#xA;&#xA;Daft Punk also produced a series of music videos for Homework directed by Spike Jonze, Michel Gondry, Roman Coppola and Seb Janiak. The collection of videos was released in 1999 and titled D.A.F.T. - A Story about Dogs, Androids, Firemen and Tomatoes.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Discovery era (1999–2004)&#xA;&#xA;By 1999 the duo were well into the recording sessions for their second album, which had begun a year earlier. 2001's Discovery took on a slicker and distinctly synthpop-oriented style, initially stunning fans of Daft Punk's previous material in Homework. The group states that the album was conceived as an attempt to reconnect with a playful, open-minded attitude associated with the discovery phase of childhood. This accounts for the heavy use of themes and samples from the late '70s to early '80s era on the album.&#xA;&#xA;It reached #2 in the United Kingdom, and its single &quot;One More Time&quot; was a major club hit, creating a new generation of fans mainly familiar with the second Daft Punk release. The singles &quot;Digital Love&quot; and &quot;Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger&quot; were also very successful in the UK and on the United States dance chart, and &quot;Face To Face&quot; hit #1 on the USA club play charts despite a limited single release. A 45-minute excerpt from a Daftendirektour performance recorded at Birmingham, UK in 1997 was also released in 2001, entitled Alive 1997.&#xA;&#xA;2003 first saw the release of the feature-length animated film Interstella 5555: The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem. Daft Punk produced the film under the supervision of Leiji Matsumoto, whom they have said is their childhood hero. The album Daft Club was also released to promote the film. It features a collection of remixes previously made available through an online membership service of the same name.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Human After All era (2004–present)&#xA;&#xA;Starting on September 13 and ending November 9, 2004, Daft Punk devoted six weeks to creating new material. The duo released the album Human After All in March 2005. Reviews were mixed, mostly citing its overly repetitive nature and seemingly rushed recording. The singles taken from this album were &quot;Robot Rock&quot;, &quot;Technologic&quot;, &quot;Human After All&quot; and &quot;The Prime Time of Your Life&quot;. The earliest official statement from Daft Punk concerning the album was &quot;we believe that Human After All speaks for itself.&quot;&#xA;&#xA;A Daft Punk anthology CD/DVD entitled Musique Vol. 1 1993-2005 was released on 4 April 2006. It contains new music videos for &quot;The Prime Time of Your Life&quot; and &quot;Robot Rock (Maximum Overdrive)&quot;. Daft Punk also released a remix album of Human After All called Human After All: Remixes. A limited edition included two kubricks of Daft Punk as robots.&#xA;&#xA;On 21 May 2006, Daft Punk premiered their first directed film, Daft Punk's Electroma at the Cannes Film Festival sidebar Director's Fortnight. The film does not include their own music, which is a first for the duo considering their previous DVD and film releases (D.A.F.T. for Homework and Interstella 5555 for Discovery). Midnight screenings of the film were shown in Paris theaters starting from the end of March 2007.&#xA;&#xA;Daft Punk released their second live album titled Alive 2007 on 19 November 2007. It contains the duo's performance in Paris from their Alive 2007 tour. The album includes a 50-page book showcasing photographs shot while on tour. The live version of &quot;Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger&quot; from Alive 2007 was released as a single. A music video for the single directed by Olivier Gondry features footage shot by 250 audience members at Daft Punk's Brooklyn appearance at KeySpan Park, Coney Island. In 2007 Daft Punk also debuted in a worldwide official poll of DJ Magazine in position 71.&#xA;&#xA;Following the Alive 2007 tour, Daft Punk focused on other projects. A 2008 interview with Pedro Winter revealed that the duo returned to their Paris studio to work on new material. Winter also stepped down from managing Daft Punk to focus attention on his Ed Banger Records label and his work as Busy P. He stated in a later interview that the duo are working with an unspecified management company in Los Angeles.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Influences&#xA;&#xA;Bangalter and de Homem-Christo have credited many sources that influenced their musical style. Years before producing electronic music as a duo, they were stated to have shared tastes for Elton John, MC5, The Rolling Stones, The Beach Boys and The Stooges. Their mutual admiration for rock bands led to the founding of their own independent project, Darlin'. Bangalter expressed that &quot;It was still maybe more a teenage thing at that time. It's like, you know, everybody wants to be in a band.&quot;They drew inspiration from the rock and acid house displayed in the United Kingdom during the early 1990s. De Homem-Christo pointed to Screamadelica by Primal Scream as an influential work, as the record &quot;put everything together&quot; in terms of genre.&#xA;&#xA;The liner notes of Homework pay tribute to a large number of musical artists and contains a quote from Brian Wilson. Bangalter expressed that &quot;In Brian Wilson's music you could really feel the beauty - it was very spiritual. Like Bob Marley, too.&quot; When questioned on the success of Daft Punk's debut album and rising popularity of their associated musical genre, Bangalter responded, &quot;before us you had Frankie Knuckles or Juan Atkins and so on. The least you can do is pay respect to those who are not known and who have influenced people.&quot; The Daft Punk track &quot;Teachers&quot; on Homework refers to several influences including RomAnthony and Todd Edwards. De Homem-Christo stated that &quot;Their music had a big effect on us. The sound of their productions — the compression, the sound of the kick drum and Romanthony's voice, the emotion and soul — is part of how we sound today.&quot;&#xA;&#xA;Romanthony and Edwards later collaborated with Daft Punk in tracks for Discovery. For the album Daft Punk focused on new styles of electronic music. A major inspiration was the Aphex Twin single &quot;Windowlicker&quot;, which was &quot;neither a purely club track nor a very chilled-out, down-tempo relaxation track&quot; according to Bangalter. The duo also utilized vintage equipment to recreate the sound of a previous artist. As stated by de Homem-Christo, &quot;On 'Digital Love' you get this Supertramp vibe on the bridge,&quot; which was generated through an in-studio Wurlitzer piano. During a later interview, de Homem-Christo clarified that &quot;we didn't make a list of artists we like and copy their songs.&quot;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Visual components&#xA;&#xA;Daft Punk are noted for their use of visual components associated with their musical productions. The music videos for their singles from Homework featured memorable characters and placed emphasis on storytelling instead of musical performance. The album Discovery subsequently became the soundtrack to Interstella 5555.&#xA;&#xA;Their outward personae have also changed over time. During their Homework years, the duo would usually wear masks to hide their appearance. When not wearing disguises, they occasionally preferred to be replaced by animation (as they appeared in The Work of Director Michel Gondry DVD) or have their faces digitally obscured for press kits. Very few photos of the duo's faces exist, including a blurry one found in the Homework liner notes.&#xA;&#xA;In their more visible Discovery years, they have appeared as futuristic robots for publicity photo shoots, interviews, live shows and music videos. These suits, engineered by Tony Gardner and Alterian, Inc., sport complicated helmets capable of various LED effects and metallic finger gloves. Daft Punk introduced the costumes to many U.S. television viewers through an advertisement for a special presentation of their videos during Cartoon Network's Toonami block. Thomas Bangalter once stated, &quot;We did not choose to become robots. There was an accident in our studio. We were working on our sampler, and at exactly 9:09 a.m. on September 9, 1999, it exploded. When we regained consciousness, we discovered that we had become robots.&quot;&#xA;&#xA;During a video interview shot in Japan, Daft Punk stated that they donned their robot masks to easily merge the characteristics of humans and machines. However, Bangalter later admitted that the costumes were initially the result of shyness. &quot;But then it became exciting from the audiences' point of view. It's the idea of being an average guy with some kind of superpower.&quot; When asked on whether the duo expressed themselves differently within the robotic suits, Bangalter stated &quot;No, we don't need to. It's not about having inhibitions. It's more like an advanced version of glam, where it's definitely not you.&quot; With the release of Human After All, the musical duo's outfits became slightly less complicated by consisting of dark leather jumpsuits and simplified versions of the Discovery head gear. The jumpsuits were designed by Hedi Slimane.&#xA;&#xA;During the filming and promotion of Daft Punk's Electroma, the duo went to great lengths to avoid showing their faces. While on the set of the film, the duo chose to be interviewed with their backs turned. As reported on October 2006, the band went as far as to wear black cloth over their heads during a televised interview.&#xA;&#xA;It is believed that the mystery of their identity and the elaborate nature of their disguises has added to their popularity. The iconic status of the robotic costumes has been compared to the makeup of Kiss and the leather jacket worn by Iggy Pop. Bangalter stated, &quot;The mask gets very hot, but after wearing it as long as I have, I am used to it.&quot;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Live performances&#xA;&#xA;In the mid-to-late nineties, Daft Punk performed live without costumes in many places including the United States. In particular, a rare bootlegged video featuring the duo in Wisconsin matches the verified identity of Thomas Bangalter. Less clearly seen, Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo is to Bangalter's right and is mostly cut off from the camera. Comparing the artwork packaging of Homework to the video footage, one can verify that the album's liner note photo was taken during this event.&#xA;&#xA;In the fall of 1997 they did their Daftendirektour to promote Homework in several cities throughout the world. For this tour Daft Punk opted to utilize their home studio equipment for the live stage instead of creating a more conventional DJ set. As Bangalter stated, &quot;Everything was synched up — the drum machines, the bass lines. The sequencer was just sending out the tempos and controlling the beats and bars. On top of this structure we built all these layers of samples and various parts that we could bring in whenever we wanted to.&quot; 25 May 1997 saw them perform at the Tribal Gathering festival at Luton Hoo, England, headlining with Orbital and Kraftwerk. Also of note is the November 8 performance in Birmingham, UK, from which came the recording of Alive 1997.&#xA;&#xA;At the start of 2006, Daft Punk announced plans for a number of special summer shows. On 29 April Daft Punk performed at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival where they received a jubilant reception for their first U.S. performance since 1997. Thomas Bangalter had initially been reported as saying that there would be a DVD of their recent live set. He later emphasized his reluctance for such a release, as the duo felt that online amateur videos of their performances were more compelling than anything captured professionally. In an interview with the Miami Herald Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo stated that their November 11 appearance at the Bang Music Festival was their final for 2006 and that Daft Punk would conduct more performances in the future. The band later specified a date for a live show at Bercy, Paris for June 2007. Also reported were dates at the Rock Ness Festival and Wireless Festival in June, the Oxegen festival in July and Lollapalooza in August. Daft Punk then announced a world tour called Alive 2007.&#xA;&#xA;Daft Punk played at the Rock Ness Festival by the banks of Loch Ness, Scotland on 10 June 2007 as the headline act in the 10,000 capacity Clash tent. To the crowds displeasure, the show was delayed, but the crowd gave the duo a jubilant welcome when they appeared. Due to popularity, part of the tent was removed to allow thousands of people outside to see the show. On 16 June 2007 Daft Punk successfully headlined the third day of the O2 Wireless Festival to positive reaction and reviews. The Times described the set as a &quot;memorable sensory spectacle, both dazzling and deafening&quot; and ThisisLondon declared it &quot;an almost faultless set of relentless electro euphoria&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;Daft Punk headlined Stage 2/NME Stage at the Oxegen music festival on 8 July 2007. Their live set was preceded by a showing of the trailer for the film Daft Punk's Electroma. Subsequent reports stated that the Daft Punk appearance was the highlight of the festival. NME expressed that the performance was &quot;a robotic spectacular&quot;, while Shoutmouth described the set as &quot;typically triumphant&quot;. Four days later, the duo played at Traffic Torino Free Festival in Parco della Pellerina in Turin, Italy.&#xA;&#xA;Daft Punk headlined the AT&amp;T stage on 3 August 2007, the first night of the Lollapalooza music festival in Chicago. Their show there was praised by Pitchfork Media stating that the experience of watching the performance &quot;was a much-needed reminder of the still-potent power of communicative pop.&quot; On August 9 they performed at KeySpan Park in Brooklyn, New York.&#xA;&#xA;Daft Punk composed the music for the Louis Vuitton Spring/Summer 2008 Womenswear Full Show on 7 October 2007. The duo also headlined the Vegoose festival in Las Vegas on 27 October. They appeared at the festival along with bands Rage Against the Machine, Muse and Queens of the Stone Age. At the end of the month, Daft Punk performed in Mexico City. The duo also performed on Friday November 2, 2007 at the Arena Monterrey in Monterrey, Mexico.&#xA;&#xA;Modular announced that Daft Punk would appear in Australia for an event in December 2007 called Never Ever Land. The announcement addressed years of speculation on whether Daft Punk would visit Australia for live performances. Never Ever Land included Australian acts The Presets, Cut Copy, Muscles, Van She and the Bang Gang Deejays. Daft Punk were supported by their regular acts Sebastian and Kavinsky at the appearances, which had been announced as an extension to the Alive 2007 tour. Never Ever Land toured to Melbourne at the Sidney Myer Music Bowl, Perth at the Esplanade, Brisbane at the Riverstage and finally Sydney at the Sydney Showground Main Arena. A Triple J interview with Pedro Winter (Busy P) revealed that Daft Punk's Sydney appearance on December 22 would be their final show for 2007 and the last to feature the pyramid light scheme. Tickets for the Australian tour sold more quickly than for any Daft Punk-related event in their history. The duo stated in an EMI-sponsored live webchat that there will be no tour performances for 2008, and that they would instead focus on new projects.&#xA;&#xA;Daft Punk made a surprise appearance at the 50th Grammy Awards on February 10, 2008.

The band consists of Ben Gibbard (vocals, guitar, piano), Chris Walla (guitar, keyboards), Nicholas Harmer (bass), and Jason McGerr (drums).&#xA;&#xA;Death Cab began as a solo project of Ben Gibbard, now the band's vocalist and guitarist. Gibbard took the band name from the satirical song Death Cab for Cutie, performed by The Bonzo Dog Band in The Beatles' 1967 experimental film Magical Mystery Tour. As Death Cab for Cutie, Gibbard released a cassette titled You Can Play These Songs With Chords; the release was surprisingly successful, and Gibbard decided to expand the band into a complete project. He recruited Chris Walla (who had also worked on the cassette) as an electric guitarist, Nick Harmer as bass guitarist, and Nathan Good to play drums. &#xA;&#xA;The four released the LP Something About Airplanes on August 18th 1998. The album was favorably reviewed in the independent music scene, and in 2000 the band released We Have the Facts and We're Voting Yes. Nathan Good left the band at some point during this album's production. His playing on “The Employment Pages” and “Company Calls Epilogue” were kept, but Gibbard played drums on all other songs.&#xA;&#xA;Michael Schorr would first appear on The Forbidden Love E.P., released on October 24, 2000. In 2001, another LP was released, entitled The Photo Album. Limited editions of this album contained three bonus tracks, which were later released separately as The Stability EP.&#xA;&#xA;In 2003, there was another change of drummer, with Jason McGerr of Eureka Farm replacing Schorr. McGerr would play drums on the next release, Transatlanticism.&#xA;&#xA;Transatlanticism was released in October of 2003. It received critical praise and also became the band's top-selling album, with 225,000 copies sold during its first year out.&#xA;&#xA;In spring of 2004, the band recorded a live E.P. titled The John Byrd E.P., named for their sound engineer. The E.P. was released on Barsuk Records in March 2004.&#xA;&#xA;In November of 2004, Death Cab for Cutie signed a “long-term worldwide deal” with Atlantic Records, leaving their long-time label Barsuk Records. Gibbard stated on the official website www.deathcabforcutie.com that nothing would change except that “Next to the picture of Barsuk holding a 7&quot;, there will be the letter &quot;A&quot; on both the spine and back of our upcoming albums.” This was a marked change from Gibbard's earlier views on major-label relations, which he said “are set up to fuck you and take all your money.”. After signing to Atlantic, the band was still nervous about corporate economics, and encouraged fans to download its songs from the Internet.&#xA;&#xA;The first and second singles off the band's Atlantic Record release Plans were “Soul Meets Body” and “Crooked Teeth”, respectively. The full album was released in August of 2005. Plans was somewhat well-acclaimed by critics and fans, and received a nomination for the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Album of 2005. It achieved Gold Status in 2006 after charting on Billboard for 47 consecutive weeks.&#xA;&#xA;The band released a touring DVD titled Drive Well, Sleep Carefully in 2005. Known for their contributions to animal rights, the band is supporting the activist group PETA in giving away copies of the DVD to promote animal rights.&#xA;&#xA;In early 2006, the band announced the upcoming release of Directions, eleven short films inspired by songs from the Plans album, each directed by a different person. The videos were posted one at a time at the band's website and the DVD went on sale April 11, 2006.&#xA;&#xA;On May 12, 2008 their album, Narrow Stairs, was released  and was well received by both critics and fans. It was their first album to reach #1 on the Billboard 200. The album contains the singles &quot;I Will Possess Your Heart&quot;, &quot;Cath...&quot; and &quot;GrapeVine Fires&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;The band's latest released The Open Door EP, which was released on March 31, 2009. Their main styles consist of slow progressive rock with dark lyrics.&#xA;&#xA;The band's seventh album, Codes and Keys, was released on May 31, 2011.

Dirt Poor Robins’ debut album The Cage will take you on a journey through love, pain, loneliness, and beauty.  Accompanying their bold lyrics are musical arrangements that merge from hard rock, to classical strings, to sympathetic ballads. &#xA;&#xA;“Our album is a concept piece that revolves around a carnival sideshow,” Kate Robins says, “but the people in it aren’t freaks of nature. They’re normal people like you and me, but what’s being exploited is their defense mechanisms against pain and loneliness.”&#xA;&#xA;“I’m really excited about the way the album has turned out, because I think we’ve gone to a place that’s musically different, yet at the same time we find the music resonating with all types of people,” Neil Robins says. “As an artist, there’s not much that makes me happier than that.”&#xA;&#xA;   &#xA;User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL." index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/3323/thumb?t=1344380640" addedAt="1344380234" updatedAt="1344380640">

			<Directory ratingKey="3508" key="/library/metadata/3508/children" type="artist" title="Frou Frou" summary="Frou Frou was an electronic music duo formed in England with two members: Imogen Heap and Guy Sigsworth, active from 2002 to 2003.&#xA;&#xA;Frou Frou created an impressive brand of vocal-driven, electronic pop. After the British duo had been collaborating for years without a record deal, the group's debut, Details, was completed for American release on MCA Records in 2002.&#xA;&#xA;Heap and Sigsworth first worked together on Getting Scared from Heap's 1998 solo record, I Megaphone. After completing the promotion for that splendid debut, Heap was ready to begin work on a new project and the two hooked up again as Sigsworth had privately been compiling music specifically for Heap while producing other projects. The first track, conceived by the new, more formal (but as yet unnamed) pairing, eventually turned into Flicks from Details, which is perhaps Frou Frou's most Björk-reminiscent number. &#xA;&#xA;Sigsworth grew up listening to eclectic female artists like Kate Bush, and along with Heap, developed an appreciation for classical music. He has specifically worked with Bj&amp;ouml;rk (Homogenic, Vespertine) and Madonna (What It Feels Like for a Girl) among many other significant '90s pop and electronic artists. Far from being the kind of campy moniker one might expect from a more sugary pop outfit, the name Frou Frou was decided upon when Francophile Sigsworth noticed the phrase in a Baudelaire poem. Apparently, when uttered in French, the phrase is meant to approximate the swishing of skirts as they swirl about the legs of comely dancing women, as in a burlesque performance. &#xA;&#xA;Born composers, multi-instrumentalist Heap and studio/sound/producer/musician Sigsworth are credited with many side appearances in support of other artists, especially Sigsworth, who was often used as a bit of a song-fixer. While those aren't bad jobs to have, artists of Frou Frou's caliber need to step out on their own, and while Heap worked as a solo artist for a majority of her career, Sigsworth had never been so strongly identified with any previous project. Instead of relegating the male producer/writer to a barely credited back seat, as often happens with a female-fronted team effort, Frou Frou was conceived and honestly portrayed as a true collaboration, making it significant for its marketing truthfulness if nothing else. &#xA;&#xA;Details has some relatively conventional pop moments like &quot;It's Good to Be in Love&quot;, but more experimental cuts like &quot;Only Got One&quot; display a more definitive quality. The true accomplishment of Frou Frou (which is in evidence on just about every track the &quot;band&quot; created) is their uncanny ability to infuse highly manipulated, digitally crafted music with a warmth quite rare in pop and almost unheard of in music so technologically progressive. In the studio, Frou Frou achieved unique sounding beats for Heap's luscious voice via more-than-would-be-expected acoustic and natural instruments. These actual instrumental performances were recorded first, then heavily manipulated in an editing stage, giving the duo their own process and thus, their own sound. This approach made their music lush, dynamic, and more earthy when compared to typical electronic/dance and canned pop.&#xA;   &#xA;User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL." index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/3508/thumb?t=1344380669" art="/library/metadata/3508/art?t=1344380669" addedAt="1344380255" updatedAt="1344380669">

The group members are Shirley Manson (vocals, guitars), Steve Marker (guitars, keyboards), Duke Erikson (guitars, keyboards, bass), and Butch Vig (drums, percussion). Erikson, Marker and Vig are also producers and remixers (Vig is best known for producing Nevermind by Nirvana).  To date, the band sold over 17 million albums worldwide.&#xA;&#xA;Initially, Garbage was an informal jam session between the three producers held in Marker's basement. Steve Marker saw the music video of &quot;Suffocate Me&quot; by Angelfish on MTV, recorded it and showcased it to his band mates. They invited the Scottish vocalist Shirley Manson to join Garbage, she accepted, and soon Angelfish disbanded. According to Vig, Garbage was named before Manson joined the band, after the percussionist Pauli Ryan walked in while Vig was working on a remix for Nine Inch Nails and said it sounded like &quot;garbage&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;In August 1995, the group released their debut album Garbage, preceded by their first single &quot;Vow&quot; in March 1995. This album was an unexpected smash, selling over 5 million copies and reaching double platinum status in the UK (#6), USA (#20), Australia. Also it received great reviews from critics and featured on the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.&quot; They released five singles from this album: &quot;Vow&quot;, &quot;Only Happy When It Rains&quot;, &quot;Queer&quot;, &quot;Stupid Girl&quot;, and &quot;Milk&quot;. A non-album single entitled &quot;Subhuman&quot; was issued on 7 August 1995.&#xA;&#xA;In 1996, the band released a short-form VHS and Video CD entitled &quot;Garbage Video&quot; (also known as &quot;Home Video&quot;), that included all of Garbage's promotional music videos filmed up until that point.&#xA;&#xA;In 1997, Garbage were nominated at Grammy Awards for Best New Artist, Best Rock Performance By a Duo or Group With Vocal for &quot;Stupid Girl&quot;, Best Rock Song for &quot;Stupid Girl&quot;. In the same year, the remixed version of &quot;#1 Crush&quot; (original version released in 1996) was included on the multi-platinum movie soundtrack William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet. Also it was nominated for Best Song From a Movie at the 1997 MTV Movie Awards.&#xA;&#xA;They spent over an year working on their follow-up album Version 2.0, which was released on May 1998 and hit #1 in the UK and #13 in the US. It was supported by six singles: &quot;Push It&quot;, &quot;I Think I'm Paranoid&quot;, &quot;Special&quot;, &quot;When I Grow Up&quot;, &quot;The Trick Is to Keep Breathing&quot; and &quot;You Look So Fine&quot;. The music video of &quot;Push It&quot; featured state of the art effects and it costs over $400,000 to make. Version 2.0 sold over 5 million copies, almost the same as their debut.&#xA;&#xA;In 1999, they performed the theme song to the James Bond movie The World Is Not Enough. That year, they also contributed the song &quot;When I Grow Up&quot; to the Adam Sandler movie Big Daddy. Version 2.0 was nominated at Grammy Awards for Album of the Year and Best Rock Album, and &quot;Special&quot; was nominated for Best Rock Performance By a Duo or Group With Vocal and Best Rock Song.&#xA;&#xA;In October 2001, Garbage issued their third and most pop album beautifulgarbage, preceded by the single &quot;Androgyny&quot; in September 2001. All four singles released (&quot;Androgyny&quot;, &quot;Cherry Lips (Go Baby Go!)&quot;, &quot;Breaking Up the Girl&quot; and &quot;Shut Your Mouth&quot;) were moderately successful. This album got 6th place at Rolling Stone's Top 10 Albums of The Year. The world tour from October 2001 to November 2002 was affected by Butch's health problems.&#xA;&#xA;The band struggled to remain together and almost split in 2003, before returning with the fourth studio album Bleed Like Me in April 2005, peaking at a career-high #4 in USA. Four singles promoted the album: &quot;Why Do You Love Me&quot;, &quot;Sex Is Not the Enemy&quot;, &quot;Bleed Like Me&quot;, and &quot;Run Baby Run&quot;. Garbage cut short their 2005 world tour, and announced an indefinite hiatus, but emphasized it was not a break-up. &#xA;&#xA;In July 2007 the group released a greatest hits album and a DVD entitled Absolute Garbage. The compilation featured a selection of their singles, a new single &quot;Tell Me Where It Hurts&quot; (#50 UK), and a remixed version of &quot;It's All Over But The Crying&quot; (the limited edition had also a remixes disc). The DVD included most of their music videos and a documentary related to the band.&#xA;&#xA;In 2008 a new track called &quot;Witness to Your Love&quot; was issued on a charity compilation in the USA. Shirley Manson recorded a solo album but her label refused to release it considering it to be &quot;too noir&quot;. In the same year she started to play a regular role on US TV show Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles.&#xA;&#xA;According to a post from Shirley's Facebook profile, the band returned back to studio in 2010. On 14 May 2012, Garbage released their fifth studio album, Not Your Kind Of People.

It was the first #1 UK single to be obtained solely through Internet downloads.

			<Directory ratingKey="3558" key="/library/metadata/3558/children" type="artist" title="Goo Goo Dolls" summary="Goo Goo Dolls is an alternative rock band formed in 1985 in Buffalo, New York by guitarist/vocalist John Rzeznik and bassist/vocalist Robby Takac. They are most famous for the hit &quot;Iris&quot;, featured on the soundtrack to the 1998 film City of Angels. Currently, the band consists of John Rzeznik (guitar, vocals), Robby Takac (vocals, bass) and Mike Malinin (drums).&#xA;&#xA;Early in their career, the Goo Goo Dolls were frequently dismissed by critics as mere imitators of The Replacements; however, the band refined its sound to be more mainstream, which helped it become one of the most popular adult alternative rock bands of the latter half of the '90s, selling millions of records to audiences largely unfamiliar with their inspirations. That's no bitch on the band, either -- their music simply improved in craft and accessibility as the years progressed, and radio happened to be receptive to what a decade earlier would have been considered collegiate power pop. Thus, the band landed two huge hits with the acoustic ballads &quot;Name&quot; and &quot;Iris.&quot;&#xA;&#xA;The Goo Goo Dolls were formed in Buffalo, NY, in 1985 by guitarist/vocalist Johnny Rzeznik and bassist Robby Takac, initially under the name the Sex Maggots (the new name was chosen from an ad in True Detective magazine at the behest of a local club owner). Originally a cover band with a taste for power pop and classic rock &amp; roll, the group soon began writing its own songs. Their early sound recalled the The Replacements' origins as a bratty punk band (circa Sorry Ma, Forgot to Take Out the Trash) -- melodic, snotty, and a little bit thrashy. That sound was the reason the band attracted the interest of the heavy metal label Metal Blade, which issued their debut album in 1987 (known either as The Goo Goo girls or First Release). 1989's Jed continued in a similar vein; the college radio breakthrough came with 1990's Hold Me Up, a Replacements-ish power pop record.&#xA;&#xA;1993's Superstar Car Wash was the Goo Goo Dolls' artistic breakthrough; though it did nothing to quell the Replacements comparisons, it was a finely crafted pop/rock record, and its lead single, &quot;We Are the Normal,&quot; was co-written with Replacements leader Paul Westerberg himself. Still, Superstar Car Wash wasn't the commercial force the band hoped it would be, especially in light of the success of similar bands like the Gin Blossoms. That all changed with 1995's A Boy Named Goo, when an L.A. rock station put the acoustic-driven ballad &quot;Name&quot; into heavy rotation. It was eventually released as a single nationwide, and went Top Five late in the year; platinum sales for the album followed close behind. Unfortunately, the original drummer was no longer around to enjoy the band's success; prior to the album's release, he'd been sacked and replaced by drummer Mike Malinin.&#xA;&#xA;Dissatisfied with the royalty rates in their Metal Blade contract, the band waged a legal battle that wound up allowing them to jump to parent company Warner Brothers. Somewhat drained, Rzeznik and the band shook off a case of writer's block to contribute the ballad &quot;Iris&quot; to the soundtrack of the 1998 americanized version of City of Angels (Featuring Nicolas Cage and Meg Ryan). Appearing that April, the song was a monster smash, although it was never released as a single (so its official Top Ten pop chart status doesn't convey how popular it was); for a better indicator, &quot;Iris&quot; spent nearly a year on Billboard's airplay charts, including an astonishing 18 weeks at number one, and was nominated for three Grammys. The band's next album, Dizzy Up the Girl, was released in September, during the middle of &quot;Iris&quot;'s marathon airplay run, and sold over three million copies. Its clean, polished sound completed the Goo Goo Dolls' transformation into mainstream pop/rockers who happened to have alternative roots. Further hits from the record followed over the next year, including &quot;Slide,&quot; &quot;Dizzy,&quot; and the Grammy-nominated &quot;Black Balloon,&quot; and the band toured heavily in support. The Goo Goo Dolls revamped their sound for 2001's career retrospective, Ego, Opinion, Art &amp; Commerce. A year later, the trio hit the charts with &quot;Here Is Gone&quot; from their seventh studio album, Gutterflower. The CD/DVD combo Live in Buffalo: July 4, 2004 helped fans endure the long wait for the band's next studio album, Let Love In, which didn't appear until 2006. The band toured through the summer of 2007. The band released the first of two greatest hits compilation, entitled Greatest Hits Volume One: The Singles, November 13th 2007. &#xA;&#xA;In February 2008, the band officially headed into studio to work on their new record.&#xA;In August 2010, the band released their newest album, Something for the Rest of Us.&#xA;&#xA;Singles:&#xA;There You Are (Hold Me Up)&#xA;Just the Way You Are (Hold Me Up)&#xA;I'm Awake Now (Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare Soundtrack)&#xA;We Are the Normal (Superstar Car Wash)&#xA;Fallin' Down (Superstar Car Wash)&#xA;Only One (A Boy Named Goo)&#xA;Flat Top (A Boy Named Goo)&#xA;Name (A Boy Named Goo)&#xA;Long Way Down (A Boy Named Goo)&#xA;Naked (A Boy Named Goo)&#xA;Lazy Eye (Batman &amp; Robin Soundtrack)&#xA;Iris (City of Angels Soundtrack/Dizzy Up the Girl)&#xA;Slide (Dizzy Up the Girl)&#xA;Black Balloon (Dizzy Up the Girl)&#xA;Dizzy (Dizzy Up the Girl)&#xA;Broadway (Dizzy Up the Girl)&#xA;Here Is Gone (Gutterflower)&#xA;Big Machine (Gutterflower)&#xA;Sympathy (Gutterflower)&#xA;Give A Little Bit (Live in Buffalo: July 4, 2004/Let Love In)&#xA;Better Days (Target's Sounds of the Season/Let Love In)&#xA;Stay With You (Let Love In)&#xA;Let Love In (Let Love In)&#xA;Before It's Too Late (Sam &amp; Mikaela's Theme) (Transformers Soundtrack)&#xA;Home (Something for the Rest of Us)&#xA;Real (AT&amp;T Team USA Soundtrack)&#xA;Not Broken (Something For The Rest Of Us)&#xA;   &#xA;User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL." index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/3558/thumb?t=1344380686" art="/library/metadata/3558/art?t=1344380686" addedAt="1344380261" updatedAt="1344380686">

			<Directory ratingKey="3587" key="/library/metadata/3587/children" type="artist" title="Gorillaz" summary="Gorillaz are a british virtual band (currently on hiatus) formed in 1998 by a collaboration between Damon Albarn of  Blur and Jamie Hewlett, co-creator of the comic book Tank Girl. They had the idea to create the band while watching MTV in their London flat and originally intended to call the project Gorilla. The band is comprised of four fictional band members: 2-D (vocals, keyboard), Murdoc Niccals (bass), Noodle (guitar, vocals), and Russel Hobbs (drums). These characters only appear in animated form and are not alter-egos of real people, as is often mistakenly assumed. There is an extensive fictional back-story behind these band members, written by Albarn and Hewlett. Their albums, several of their music videos, and their autobiographical book Rise Of The Ogre all tell the saga. Damon Albarn is the only permanent musical contributor to the band, which is a collaboration between various musicians. Their style is broad, with a large number of alternative influences including rock, hip-hop, and electronica.&#xA;&#xA;They have released three studio albums: Gorillaz (2001), Demon Days (2005), and Plastic Beach (2010). Additionally, they have put out two B-side collections, G-Sides (2001) and D-Sides (2007), and a reggae remix of the Gorillaz album entitled Laika Come Home (2002). The band has also released three DVDs: Phase One: Celebrity Takedown, Demon Days: Live at Manchester Opera House, and Phase Two: Slow Boat To Hades. At the end of 2010, Gorillaz released their next album, The Fall, which was recorded during their US 'Escape to Plastic Beach' tour. It is promoted as being the first album made entirely on iPad. The album is streamed on the Gorillaz website.&#xA;&#xA;The band's first single, Clint Eastwood, was released on 5 March 2001. This single was the first of four from Gorillaz, which was released  on 26 March 2001. The other three singles were released over the next year. These were: 19-2000, Rock the House, and Tomorrow Comes Today. The album sold over 7 million copies worldwide and has gone platinum twice in the United Kingdom earning them an entry in the Guinness Book of Records as the Most Successful Virtual Band. It was nominated for the Mercury Prize, but the nomination was later withdrawn at the band's request. Collaborators on the first album included Del Tha Funkee Homosapien (often mistaken as a band-member), Miho Hatori (formerly of Cibo Matto), Tina Weymouth of Talking Heads.and Ibrahim Ferrer. The album was produced by Dan the Automator.&#xA;&#xA;At the end of 2001 the band released another single, 911, which was a collaboration between Gorillaz and rap artists D12, Eminem and Terry Hall. The single was from the soundtrack to the 2002 action comedy Bad Company.&#xA;&#xA;Their second studio album, Demon Days, was released on 11 May  2005 and included the hit singles Feel Good Inc., DARE, Dirty Harry and Kids with Guns / El Ma&amp;ntilde;ana. Demon Days went five times platinum in the UK, double platinum in the United States, and earned five Grammy award nominations for 2006 and won one of them (Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals). Collaborators on this album (produced by DJ Danger Mouse) include De La Soul, Bootie Brown of The Pharcyde, Shaun Ryder of Happy Mondays, Neneh Cherry, Ike Turner, MF DOOM, and Roots Manuva, amongst others.&#xA;&#xA;In late 2007, Albarn and Hewlett began working on Carousel, a new Gorillaz project which eventually evolved into the band's third studio album, Plastic Beach, which was released 9 March 2010. Albarn said, &quot;I'm making this one the most pop record I've ever made in many ways, but with all my experience to try and at least present something that has got depth.” The album features guest performances by Snoop Dogg, Lou Reed, Mos Def, Bobby Womack, Gruff Rhys, Mark E. Smith, Mick Jones, Paul Simonon, Kano, Bashy, De La Soul, Little Dragon, Hypnotic Brass Ensemble, Sinfonia Viva, and The Lebanese National Orchestra for Oriental Arabic Music. &#xA;&#xA;A 3D projection of the group was shown at the 2005 MTV Music Awards and the 2006 Grammys. They also performed at the Brits, in a different format, using screens rather than projections. Gorillaz have performed live in other occasions as well: in 2001 &amp; 2002 they did tours where the musicians played behind screens, and in 2005 &amp; 2006, Gorillaz had five nights in Manchester and New York respectively. This time the screens were behind the musicians, who were visible to the audience only as silhouettes (except for the guest-stars).&#xA;&#xA;Since the band began to achieve mainstream success, there have been rumours of them working on a full-length movie. Some of these have been confirmed, but nothing has gotten beyond planning stages, mainly due to conflicts between the band and studios involved. In 2008, Hewlett said &quot;Ultimately we didn't think that feel we're in a position to make the kind of movie we want to make with Gorillaz at the moment. [...] But I'd still like to make a full, lavishly-animated Gorillaz movie someday.&quot;&#xA;&#xA;Albarn and Hewlett created a Pop Opera called Monkey: Journey to the West, which premiered in the summer of 2007 at the Manchester International Festival. A soundtrack album was recorded in the summer as well (initially only digitally available though a CD version was released in 2008). The production went on to show at the Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris in September-October 2007, the Spoleto Festival in Charleston, SC, USA in May 2008, and the Royal Opera House in London in July 2008.&#xA;&#xA;The duo behind the Pop Opera built on ideas from Monkey: Journey to the West to release a short film in the Summer of 2008 which accompanied the United Kingdom's coverage of the BBC Olympic Coverage in Beijing. It featured a basic outline of the main plot elements of the Opera, reworked into a &quot;Journey to the East&quot;, with the characters finishing in the Beijing Olympic Stadium. &#xA;&#xA;Gorillaz headlined the Pyramid Stage at Glastonbury 2010, as an immediate replacement for U2, who dropped out of performing at the festival.&#xA;&#xA;At the end of 2010 Gorillaz released their next album The Fall made in the hotel rooms during their US tour. It is the first album made entirely on iPad. The album is streamed on the Gorillaz website and was available for free download for a limited time.&#xA;&#xA;In April 2012, Albarn told The Guardian that he and Hewlett had fallen out and that future Gorillaz projects were &quot;unlikely&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;Gorillaz's current live band's lineup includes &#xA;Damon Albarn - Vocals, keyboards, guitar, bass guitar &#xA;Jamie Hewlett - Illustration, visuals, FX &#xA;Mike Smith&#xA;Mick Jones - guitar&#xA;Paul Simonon - bass&#xA;Cass Browne - Drums, percussion &#xA;   &#xA;User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL." index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/3587/thumb?t=1344380696" art="/library/metadata/3587/art?t=1344380696" addedAt="1344380266" updatedAt="1344380696">

			<Directory ratingKey="3733" key="/library/metadata/3733/children" type="artist" title="Greenskeepers" summary="Greenskeepers is forever changing as a meeting of minds and a catalog of music. The name was founded by childhood friends James Curd and Nick Maurer in 1999. James and Nick grew up skateboarding together in Chicago. Nick bounced around local punk bands while James was djing in Chicago clubs and raves when he was only 15 years old. &#xA;&#xA;At the age of 18 James built up a music studio and began producing Chicago house. His first release came out on the french label Basenotic in 1999. Soon after James released &quot;Whats Your Man Got To Do WIth Gan&quot; on Classic Records. He released it under the new Greenskeepers name and forever left it's mark in the electronic music world. The stand out song on the EP was &quot;Low and Sweet&quot; which was named one of the &quot;Festive Fifty by British dj John Peel.  This helped make James an international Dj that was constantly traveling to spread the Greenskeepers sound.&#xA;&#xA;In early 2001 Nick and James went in the studio together to record. The result of this effort was the single &quot;Should I Sing Like This?&quot; It was a international club hit and showcased Nicks unique vocal stylings.&#xA;&#xA;After the success of &quot;Should I Sing Like This&quot; Nick made the big move over to Heidelberg Germany. This left James on his own to build on the Greenskeepers legacy. &#xA;&#xA;It was at this time in 2002 that James released swing house music under the Greenskeepers name. &quot;Low and Sweet&quot; was a fore shadowing of the new style that would take the dance floors over. He also established a new record label &quot;G-Swing&quot; specifically dedicated to this sound.&#xA;&#xA;After Nick moved away James collaborated with many other artist that shared his love of electronic music. He worked with a talented keyboard player named Mark Share on remixes and original music. It was easy to see that James and Mark worked well together and James featured 3 of Marks songs on the debut Greenskeepers album &quot;The Ziggy Franklin Radio Show&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;Mark became a full member of Greenskeepers in 2004 and brought his talented  bass playing friend Coban Rudish on board.&#xA;&#xA;Now that there were three Greenskeepers they went in the studio to work on their second album &quot;Pleetch&quot;. Pleetch was released by Classic records in the U.K and OM records in the United States. It featured guest vocalist and even had Nick on two of the songs that he created with the new band on a week long studio trip to Chicago.&#xA;&#xA;Pleetch was greatly received across the music world. The quirky song  &quot;Lotion&quot; , that is inspired by the cult figure Buffalo Bill from The Silence of the Lambs was an underground hit. James cut a video using the original film footage and uploaded it online. In less then two weeks the &quot;Lotion music Video&quot; had been downloaded over one million times. Pleetch also had commercial success by licensing songs to T.V and film. &quot;Lotion&quot;,&quot; Back In the Wild&quot;, and &quot;You Don't Know Me&quot; were all featured on the hit show &quot;Greys Anatomy&quot;.  &quot;Slippin&quot; was featured on C.S.I Miami and &quot;Keep It Down&quot; was featured on &quot;Point Pleasant&quot;.  &#xA;&#xA;Now that the Greenskeepers had a new album they put together a LIVE show to rock the clubs with. The show consisted of James djing, Mark playing Keys and Coban playing bass. This version of the live show blew crowds away from Scotland to Jerusalem to Los Angeles.  They toured as a three piece band for all of 2004 and then Nick moved back to Chicago to rejoin the Greenskeepers and debuted the full four piece band at Miami music conference in 2005. Billboard called it the stand out performance of the conference. &#xA;&#xA;Finally there were four Greenskeepers all living in Chicago and it was time to cultivate the new sound by all being in the studio at the same time.  The finished product of this teamwork was &quot;Polo Club&quot; released on OM. &quot;Polo Club&quot; is a two disc album. The first disc is 17 electronic, rock songs. The second disc is a continuous DJ mix by James. The title song &quot;Polo Club&quot; and &quot;15 Minutes&quot; were released with remixes by The Rapture, Derrick Carter, Dimitri from Paris, Tommie Sunshine and more.  &quot;Polo Club&quot; was given amazing reviews and full marks in magazines around the world. Their version of &quot;I Want A New Drug&quot; was featured in the film &quot;What Happens In Vegas&quot; and it was time to hit the road again.&#xA;&#xA;James and the band were constantly touring at some of the most respected clubs and festivals around the world. Park life in Australia, T In the Park in Scotland, Electric Daisy in Ireland and SXSW here in the States.&#xA;&#xA;Rockstar games contacted James with a request to feature a song on their new game &quot;Grand Theft Auto 4&quot;  The guys kicked ideas around and came up with the song &quot;Vagabond&quot;. It was made by James, Mark, Nick and long time friend and singer JDub. It was a perfect marriage of rock, dance and great back and forth vocals by Nick and JDub.  Rockstar loved the song so much that they used it for the worldwide T.V. ad campaign. &#xA;&#xA;It was at this time in 2008 that James shifted gears and focused on working on new solo songs and collaborating with other artist. He made &quot;Pick Up What I'm Putting Down&quot; that was featured on Mark Farinas Fabric mix CD. He released a full mix CD on GKM/OM for the Australian super club Electric Circus called &quot;Limbo Sessions&quot;.  James also went back into the studio with Nick like the early days when it was just the two of them. Nick and James finished a full album and wanted to do something special with it.  With the new album finished Nick was missing the European lifestyle and made the move back to Germany. James called up longtime friend Tommie Sunshine and set the stage for a outside the box collaboration.  James handed over all the studio sessions to Tommie and he put his special Sunshine touch on all the songs with live drums and a massive sound. This album is going to be released under the Greenskeepers name making Tommie a walk on band member for the new live show!&#xA;&#xA;Currently James is touring the wold as a DJ and also with the band. Currently it is a three piece with JDub on Vocals, Mike Steve on Bass and James on keys and vocals too. When the new album is released Tommie with join the band to make it a four piece.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Things have not slowed down in 2009 for james with the signing of his single &quot;We Just Won't Stop&quot; that features JDub on vocals to DFA. This single is set to be released in June of 2009. He also remixed &quot;The Juan Macleans&quot; single &quot;One Day&quot; for DFA as well.

The band released a new album in 2005, Little by Little..., after the five year hiatus that followed the release of their sophomore album &quot;King James Version&quot;. Harvey Danger has a devoted cult following but is widely considered to be a one-hit wonder, mainly due to limited mainstream radio airplay and a lack of decent record deals. &#xA;&#xA;The band is little known in Europe, for the same reasons but also because the band focuses on selling themselves in America (especially Seattle), thus making it very difficult for fans to get albums in Europe.

			<Directory ratingKey="3739" key="/library/metadata/3739/children" type="artist" title="Hoobastank" summary="Hoobastank is an american post-grunge band best known for their crossover hit &quot;The Reason&quot; (2003) and by their continued success in the modern rock market.&#xA;&#xA;Vocalist Doug Robb met with guitarist Dan Estrin in a high school battle of the bands competition and decided to form a band. They recruited Markku Lappalainen and Chris Hesse to form Hoobastank. In an interview with Yahoo's Launch, Doug Robb said the name had no particular meaning. &quot;You're going to ask me what it means. It doesn't mean anything. And it's really cool, it's one of those old high school inside-joke words that didn't really mean anything.&quot; [1] Rob Bourdon of Linkin Park attended the same high school as the members of Hoobastank.&#xA;Hoobastank started playing gigs in their local area and, with their unique saxophone section headed by Jeremy Wasser, recorded a self-released album called They Sure Don't Make Basketball Shorts Like They Used To in 1998. By this stage, they had developed a strong reputation in Southern California. This attracted interest from Island Records who signed the band in 2000. The bands reputation grew further on tours with the similar sounding band Incubus who come from the same area of Los Angeles and Alien Ant Farm.&#xA;&#xA;Hoobastank released their self-titled debut in November 2001. The first single was Crawling In The Dark which was a breakthrough hit reaching #68 on the Billboard Hot 100, #3 on the modern rock chart, #8 on the mainstream rock chart and #1 on an MP3.com download chart in early 2002. The second single Running Away was even more successful reaching #44 on the Billboard Hot 100, #2 on the modern rock chart, #9 on the mainstream rock chart and #3 on the MP3.com download chart. The Hoobastank album went platinum on the back of these hits and reached #25 on the Billboard 200 album charts and #1 on the Billboard Heatseeker chart. The album also achieved recognition internationally with the album touring in Europe and Asia in support of the record. Remember Me, the third single, was a moderate hit reaching #23 on the modern rock charts and #9 on the mainstream rock charts.&#xA;The band entered the studio in 2003 with producer Howard Benson who has produced records by P.O.D., Cold and The Crystal Method. However, recording was disrupted for a month when Dan Estrin was seriously injured in a freak minibike accident in August. Estrin had recovered by October and the band headed off on a Nokia Unwired Tour with The All-American Rejects and Ozomatli in November.&#xA;Their second album The Reason was released in December 2003. The first single Out Of Control was made available for download on the band's website. Doug Robb says on the band's website: &quot;A lot of it is about asking questions or questioning all that people see. It's not all about religion. 'Out of Control' is about that and about opening your eyes after being blinded by being devoted to anything.&quot; [2] &quot;Out of Control&quot; would reach #9 on the US modern rock chart, #16 on the mainstream rock chart and #16 on a composite world modern rock chart (based on the US, Germany, the UK, Sweden, Finland, Canada and Australia). The Reason initially reached a peak of #45 on the Billboard 200.&#xA;The title track was released as a single in the first half of 2004. It became a massive hit reaching #2 on the Billboard Hot 100 (chart proof), #1 on the US and world modern rock charts, #1 on a world airplay chart in May 2004, #10 in Australia and #12 in the UK. The Reason album received a new lease of life on the US album charts reaching #3 on the Billboard 200.&#xA;&#xA;Additionally, on 15 June 2009, the band played a prank on Iranian protesters and their supporters during the 2009 Iranian election protests using the popular Web 2.0 service Twitter and the shock image Goatse, featuring a naked man stretching his anus to a large size with both hands, with the inside of his rectum clearly visible. While thousands of protesters used the Twitter service to rapidly spread information on street level protests and the shocking behavior of pro-government militias and security forces, Hoobastank allegedly spread links to the image disguised as relevant news items and twittered them to thousands of their fans and followers. The punk rockers have since announced their satisfaction with the number of the political enthusiasts having viewed the image unintentionally (over 2 million, according to the site's usage statistics). As of June 2009, Twitter's verification system for celebrities has not officially validated either twitter account.&#xA;&#xA;Seven Amazingly Fascinating Things About Hoobastank&#xA;&#xA;1) Guitarist Dan Estrin has a great story involving brain surgery and a catheter.&#xA;In 2003, during the band's tour for its multi-platinum second album The Reason, Estrin made a fateful purchase. &quot;Everyone in the band rides street bikes and motocross bikes,&quot; says the guitarist. &quot;I was fucking around on a mini-bike that I just bought. I was riding one around after a show ... and I smashed my head into concrete.&quot; The result? &quot;They had to cut my head open. I just remember, before the surgery, I had two fears: they'd have shave my head and I'd wake up with a catheter in me. So I wake up, and lo and behold, my head's shaved and there's a tube in my dick.&quot;&#xA;&#xA;2) There are flutes and seven minute songs on the new album (blame Pink Floyd).&#xA;If you liked the infectious pop-rock stylings of the last two Hoobastank albums, you'll enjoy Every Man for Himself just as much, if not more. That said, Every Man does offer up some variety, even while maintaining the band's core sound. The epic &quot;More Than a Memory&quot;, for example, features flutes, accordion, chimes and trumpets. &quot;I was listening to a lot of Pink Floyd at the time, especially The Wall,&quot; remembers Estrin. &quot;I like albums, and songs, that take you on a journey, that almost come across as a movie. And that song definitely does - it's like Floyd, the Beatles, and even tails off like &quot;Sir Psycho Sexy,&quot; that old Red Hot Chili Peppers song. I just like applying lessons from bands I admire.&quot;&#xA;&#xA;3) Did we mention the Journey influence?&#xA;Listen to &quot;Moving Forward&quot; and prepare to recognize a very familiar classic rock refrain. &quot;We wrote that song when Doug was driving one day and heard Journey's 'Lovin' Touchin' Squeezin' on the radio,&quot; says Estrin. &quot;We like Journey; we're not huge fans, but I really liked that 'na na na na' part of the song.&quot; He laughs. &quot;I don't think it's stealing. We made it our own style.&quot;&#xA;&#xA;4) Music critics despise them. The feeling is mutual.&#xA;&quot;The album comes out in April. I expect we'll do some shows, meet fans, and have critics ready to tear it apart,&quot; says Robb. &quot;Honestly, I want to go 'fuck it, it's not for you, it's for me and the guys in the band.' If we're happy with it, that's what counts. We get a lot of shit because we don't go out of our way to be 'different' ... we're just trying to be who we are. And that's actually the theme of the album - being yourself.&quot;&#xA;&#xA;5) Speaking of message boards, you can find a lot of fun, weird stuff about Hoobastank on theirs... and some of it might be true.&#xA;&#xA;* Dan used to be a roadie for Incubus.&#xA;* Chris worked in a plant nursery for 5 years.&#xA;* Doug and Dan used to be counselors at the YMCA.&#xA;* The name of the band? It's the &quot;H&quot; in Jesus H. Christ. At least, that's what Doug will tell you.&#xA;&#xA;6) That's a real drill sergeant on the album. He's there for a reason.&#xA;&quot;Born to Lead&quot; features the barking cadence of Sgt. Dale Guy. &quot;I wouldn't want him there all the time, but he was cool,&quot; says Robb. &quot;The song was about people wishing and praying for things instead of doing something to accomplish their dreams. It's about getting off your ass, and I think the Sarge added a lot to the song's vibe.&quot;&#xA;&#xA;7) They recorded Every Man for Himself in a really backward, inefficient, grueling kind of way.&#xA;The band started work on the album during Hooba's last mega-tour. Estrin would come up with musical ideas during sound checks, then record a demo later, hand it off to Doug for melodies and lyrics, and finally, fly home with the whole band to record the finished product during non-tour weekends. &quot;It wasn't an ideal way of doing things,&quot; admits Robb. &quot;But I think, strangely, it affected us in a positive way. Maybe it was the energy of being on tour, but I think the results came out far better than our previous two records.&quot; &#xA;   &#xA;User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL." index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/3739/thumb?t=1344380706" art="/library/metadata/3739/art?t=1344380706" addedAt="1344380280" updatedAt="1344380706">

The video can also be seen on 'FUSE On Demand', and 100 video outlets nationwide. In October 2009, Hotspur won the nationwide fan vote on MTV’s mtvU program, “The Freshmen”, for  the video, “Chandelier”, defeating competition from major-label artists across several genres of music. As a result, this video was placed in mtvU’s regular rotation for the Fall.  MTV.com deemed the band, “buzzworthy”, and recommended that viewers “keep them on your radar.” In addition, the “Chandelier” single has received strong support on a number of East Coast rock radio stations.&#xA;&#xA;Hotspur was also selected for Taco Bell's “Feed the Beat” marketing program, along with notable acts as All-American Rejects, Boys Like Girls, and Owl City. Hotspur has been on tour since the album’s July release, supporting such artists as Boys Like Girls and Metro Station. The tour continues into 2010, including a December tour with recent RCA-signees, 2 AM Club. Hotspur performed at SXSW, and headlines major concert venues which include DC's prestigious 9:30 Club, and  Rams Head Live - Baltimore MD.&#xA;&#xA;Trailblazing indie magazine Alternative Press featured Hotspur in its August 2009 issue, informing their loyal readers: “Hotspur combine intricate piano and heartfelt melodies with enough electronics to keep pop-punk and club kids content.” &#xA;&#xA;“You Should Know Better By Now” is an immediately captivating album, one that draws you in at the first listen.” Metro Weekly (Washington, DC)&#xA;&#xA;Singer/songwriter Joe Mach and keyboard player Dave Trichter formed Hotspur while both were undergraduates at the University of Maryland.  Inspired by the sophisticated songwriting and dynamic live performances of bands such as The Killers and Muse, the duo aspired to create “the sound of rock ’n’ roll evolving”—grandiose vocals and crunchy guitars, infused with intricate piano work and hip-hop inspired synthesizers.   Drummer Scott Robinson joined the band after producing their debut EP. Dave “Coop” Cooper soon joined on bass. The band was christened “Hotspur” after the rash and hot-headed Shakespearean villain, namesake to the cult favorite UK football team.&#xA;&#xA;Their debut album “Beta” garnered universal praise and an infectious buzz:&#xA;“This is a debut? It’s self-assured and confident enough to be a third or fourth album.” PopMatters.com&#xA;&#xA;Eight of the album’s 10 songs landed on MTV programs and garnered Hotspur a spot on Warped Tour 2007.&#xA;&#xA;Hotspur truly shines onstage. With the addition of guitar ace Evan Anderson in late-2008, the band has evolved into a five-man barrage of sound. Constant touring, stadium-caliber live performances, and tireless attention paid to their growing legion of fans will all contribute to one day making Hotspur a household name.&#xA;&#xA;   &#xA;User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL." index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/3794/thumb?t=1344380706" addedAt="1344380288" updatedAt="1344380706">

Initially named &quot;The Hush,&quot; the band changed their name to &quot;The Hush Sound&quot; when Geffen Records objected that their name was too similar to rapper Hush. The band consists of Bob Morris on vocals and guitar, Mike Leblanc on bass and vocals, Darren Wilson on drums and vocals, and Greta Salpeter on vocals and piano. Original bassist Chris Faller left the band in October 2008 in order to pursue other musical interests and was replaced by Mike LeBlanc, who had toured with them previously on their &quot;Dance Across the Country Tour&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;In 2005 the band released their first studio album So Sudden. Their second studio album, Like Vines, was released in 2006 on Fueled by Ramen.&#xA;&#xA;The Hush Sound was founded by Greta Salpeter and Bob Morris. The two met when Greta was in 7th grade and Bob was in 10th. In the eyes of many of their peers, Bob and Greta were deemed an &quot;odd couple.&quot; Bob had always been a player and performer of rock music, whereas Greta was a classical pianist.&#xA;&#xA;By the end of March of 2005, The Hush Sound took their music into the studio to record their debut full-length album. The studio was the Gallery of Carpet located in Villa Park, IL run by owner Brian Zieske. They named it &quot;So Sudden&quot;--a reflection on how quickly things were moving for the band. They released their first album with no label support at the time, but nevertheless sold 300 CDs in two nights.&#xA;&#xA;Five months later, the band began playing shows. They soon gained the attention of Fall Out Boy’s Pete Wentz. On the day they were streaming &quot;So Sudden&quot; on purevolume, Ryan Ross of Panic at the Disco discovered their page and passed it along to Pete Wentz. Wentz knew Bob from his previous work in Chicago-based band The Audition, and, after listening, he sent The Hush Sound an email saying that he was interested in signing them to his Decaydance Records label.&#xA;&#xA;So Sudden was re-released on Decaydance (with some minor lyric changes) and the band soon became a part of the 2006 Black Clouds and Underdogs tour, with Fall Out Boy in the headlining slot and also featuring From First To Last, Hawthorne Heights, and the All-American Rejects. During this time, the band started recording the follow-up to So Sudden, entitled Like Vines, which was produced by Sean O'Keefe and Fall Out Boy's Patrick Stump (who also does guest vocals on the song &quot;Don't Wake Me Up&quot;).&#xA;&#xA;Like Vines was released on June 6, 2006. In support of the new record, the band went on a summer tour with label mates Panic at the Disco and fellow cabaret-rock band The Dresden Dolls. The album has since sold steadily. The band took a month-long break before beginning another tour with Jack's Mannequin, Copeland, and Daphne Loves Derby.&#xA;&#xA;In November 2006, The Hush Sound embarked on their first headlining tour, supported by This Providence, This Is Me Smiling, and Murder by Death.  Since then, they've toured heavily all over the United States with Straylight Run, Spitalfield, Hellogoodbye, Boys Like Girls, and Pablo among others, making stops including the Wiltern in Los Angeles, The Warfield in San Francisco, and the SXSW festival in Austin, TX.&#xA;&#xA;The band's third studio album, Goodbye Blues, was named one of the Most Anticipated Albums of 2008 according to Alternative Press Magazine. &quot;GOODBYE BLUES&quot; was recorded Fall 2007 at North Hollywood's Fairfax Recordings with producer/engineer Kevin Augunas (Cold War Kids, Jon Brion) at the helm. In tracks such as &quot;Honey&quot; and &quot;Medicine Man&quot;,The Hush Sound shows influence of Blues, Swing, Rock, and Folk. On January 16th, a press release said that that album would in fact be released on March 18th and that the first single, Honey, would be available for purchase on the iTunes store on February 5th.&#xA;&#xA;Goodbye Blues is available for purchase through The Hush Sound's official website.&#xA;   &#xA;User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL." index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/5243/thumb?t=1344380707" addedAt="1344380475" updatedAt="1344380707">

After Akon recognized that Gaga also had vocal talent, he signed her to a joint deal with his own label, Kon Live Distribution, and then she started to work on her own new material for her debut album.&#xA;&#xA;Gaga released &quot;The Fame&quot; in 2008, which she explained was &quot;about how anyone can feel famous.&quot; To date, the album has spawned the international number one hit singles &quot;Just Dance&quot; (nominated for Best Dance Recording at the 51st Grammy Awards) and &quot;Poker Face.&quot; The Fame then went Diamond in February 2010, Selling over 12 million copies worldwide.&#xA;&#xA;She then continued to release a new album 1 year later, &quot;The Fame Monster&quot;, which she wasn't intending to make at first. She released &quot;Bad Romance&quot; as the first single, and has been nominated for dozens of awards all over the world. After The Fame Monster was released she released two more singles &quot;Telephone (feat. Beyonce)&quot; and &quot;Alejandro&quot;. She released &quot;Dance in the Dark&quot; as a promotional single, but only released it in Australia, New Zealand and France. She has been touring almost constantly since &quot;The Fame Monster&quot; was released, referring to her shows as The Monster Ball.&#xA;&#xA;Lady Gaga announced her new album name, &quot;Born This Way&quot; at the 2010 MTV VMAs. It is set to be released in 2011, an official date has not been set yet.&#xA;&#xA;   &#xA;User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL." index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/2939/thumb?t=1344380777" art="/library/metadata/2939/art?t=1344380777" addedAt="1344380190" updatedAt="1344380777">

McDonald left the band in November 2007 for a solo career before returning in 2011. During that time, Cody Collins, who had formerly been in another country group called McAlyster, replaced McDonald as the band's lead vocalist. John Rich was also the group's bass guitarist and second lead vocalist until 1998, when he was fired from the group. He left for a solo career, before joining Big Kenny in the duo Big &amp; Rich in 2003. Since Rich's departure, Lonestar has not had an official bass guitarist.&#xA;&#xA;The group began having major country hits in 1995, with the top 10 hit &quot;Tequilla Talking.&quot; Their first No. 1 hit was &quot;No News,&quot; which spent three weeks at the top of Billboard magazine's Hot Country Singles chart in 1996.&#xA;&#xA;Lonestar's signature song is &quot;Amazed,&quot; a ballad which spent nine weeks at No. 1 on Billboard's country chart during the summer of 1999. The song subsequently climbed to the top of Billboard's Hot 100 chart, the first country act to accomplish the feat since 1983's &quot;Islands in the Stream&quot; by Kenny Rogers and Dolly Parton.&#xA;&#xA;Another popular Lonestar song was &quot;Mr. Mom&quot;.

			<Directory ratingKey="2924" key="/library/metadata/2924/children" type="artist" title="Marianas Trench" summary="Marianas Trench is a Juno award nominated Canadian pop rock band from Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada signed to 604 Records. The band was formed in 2001 and released their first full length album Fix Me on October 3, 2006. Some of the demos the band sent out four years before appear on the album. The band says their biggest musical influences are Queen, Foo Fighters, The Beach Boys and Ben Folds Five.&#xA;&#xA;The band released their second studio album on February 24, 2009 entitled Masterpiece Theatre.&#xA;&#xA;It takes some real cojones to include the word 'Masterpiece' in your album title, but Josh Ramsay isn't too worried. &quot;I suppose I could be digging myself into a hole calling the record Masterpiece Theatre,&quot; he chuckles, &quot;but it's tongue-in-cheek. And I'm not the kind of person that people would assume as being an egomaniac. I hope not, anyway.&quot;&#xA;&#xA;Given his feverish imagination and comprehensive musical gifts, Ramsay could probably get away with a little egomania. And with the release of Masterpiece Theatre, the frontman of Vancouver's Marianas Trench makes a iron-clad case for a prodigious set of talents - both his own and those of his bandmates, guitarist Matt Webb, bassist Mike Ayley, and drummer Ian Casselman. &#xA;&#xA;Marianas Trench had already elevated itself above the rest of the pack with a 2006 debut, Fix Me, that showcased a knack for colouring outside the lines of factory-issue millenial punk, shrewdly-built pop, and super-adrenalized modern rock. The single and in particular the video &quot;Shake Tramp&quot; was enough to demonstrate these qualities, coupled with Ramsay's uninhibited urge to be the complete song-and-dance man. &#xA;&#xA;But with both the industry and the fans beating down the door for a quick second album, the Trench decided to put on the brakes. &quot;All of a sudden you have six months to do your next record,&quot; Ramsay sighs. &quot;So I really had to just put my foot down and say, 'No, I need the time to do this.' I was not interested in putting something out for the sake of putting something out.&quot; &#xA;&#xA;Two years later, Marianas Trench has re-emerged with Masterpiece Theatre. And not surprisingly, it's a work of soaring ambition and decisive technical prowess – that easily might not have happened. &quot;It's one thing when you're Chad Kroeger and you just finished writing 'How You Remind Me',&quot; Ramsay states. &quot;I didn't have some mega-platinum song to back up my argument with, so I was lucky that the band and the label trusted me enough to do it.&quot;&#xA;&#xA;By &quot;it&quot;, Ramsay means he was allowed to indulge a high-concept fantasy for the band's sophomore album, which is built, for starters, around a song called &quot;Masterpiece Theatre&quot;. Adopting Brian Wilson's notion of the 'pocket symphony' and then running with it, the three distinct versions of “Masterpiece Theatre” dotted across the record feature an almost perfect balance between the vocal theatrics of Queen and the more hymnal qualities of the Beach Boys. &#xA;&#xA;By the time “Masterpiece Theatre” is reprised for a final, climactic time, every other song on the album is quoted and incorporated into an intricately constructed dramatic revue that swings from pristine pop, to propulsive riff rock, to quasi-doo wop, to robotic new wave, and finally into a wholly satisfying thematic payoff. &#xA;&#xA;&quot;You know in the climax of a musical, there's always that medley at the end, and I thought that would be cool on a rock record,&quot; explains Ramsay, &quot;but it turned out to be a lot harder than I thought it would be. I wrote it in the studio as we recorded it, and it took about three weeks.&quot;&#xA;&#xA;After a beat, he adds, &quot;But really it took me two years because it draws from all the songs on the whole album.&quot;&#xA;&#xA;Bassist Mike Ayley readily admits, &quot;I don't think any of the three ‘Masterpiece Theatre’ songs could have gone on Fix Me had they been written at the time. ‘Masterpiece’ 2 and 3 in particular are amazing songs that really explore the potential of Josh's writing. You really have to hear them to get it. It's like trying to explain ‘Bohemian Rhapsody’ to somebody who has only heard Kanye West and Katy Perry.&quot; &#xA;&#xA;Ramsay agrees. &quot;I really wanted to have a 'Good Vibrations'/'Bohemian Rhapsody’ style song on the first record,” he says, “but I don't think I was a mature enough writer to have written it yet, and I still feel like I was in over-my-head when we did this one, and I just barely made it.&quot;&#xA;&#xA;Ramsay is unnecessarily modest; the whole of Masterpiece Theatre demonstrates a startling compositional maturity compared to the Marianas Trench of two years ago. &#xA;&#xA;&quot;Beside You&quot; is a panoramic exercise in big emotions, with a dash of the Dream Academy's &quot;Life In a Northern Town”. &quot;Acadia&quot; begins with a clipped, bright acoustic guitar, and blossoms into something like the Who reconsidered by U2, reimagined for the net generation. In the crunchy &quot;All to Myself&quot;, the power ballad &quot;Lover Dearest&quot;, and the strident &quot;Good to You&quot; (in which he duets with Kate Voegele), Ramsay pulls out the kind of honeyed vocals more attuned to modern RnB than white, adolescent rock.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;I always had that aspect in my voice but the first record just didn't have songs that were conducive to me singing that way,&quot; he states. &quot;I think it's from growing up listening to a lot of Michael Jackson. With these songs, it made sense to stretch out a little more.&quot;&#xA;&#xA;On &quot;Cross My Heart&quot; and &quot;Celebrity Status&quot;, the band conjures up a kind of perfect pop crossover. Producer Dave 'Rave' Ogilvie was responsible for the latter track, which cops a move he used on Marilyn Manson's &quot;Beautiful People&quot; with three drummers (Casselman, Ramsay and Shane Wilson) playing at once - much to Ramsay's delight. &quot;He's just worked with so many great artists which makes his well of tricks and ideas so vast,&quot; he says. &#xA;&#xA;True to Ramsay's quest for &quot;more diversity on this album&quot; - not to mention the indulgence of his record label - Rave was just one of four prominent guest producers eventually roped into Masterpiece Theatre. Their collective resume includes Nine Inch Nails, Sum 41, Iggy Pop, Avril Lavigne, and Hedley among others.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;I feel really fortunate to have worked with all those guys,&quot; Ramsay says, &quot;coz they all bring really unique things. Dave Genn and I have a really good working relationship with each other, and he has such a unique style with arrangement and stuff. Greig Nori was a really pleasant surprise. As far as I can tell, he wanted to work with us because he liked our video. The whole time he was just trying to get me to dance around like an idiot. And Raine Maida, man? Raine's a trip!&quot;&#xA;&#xA;Bassist Ayley also credits Maida for encouraging the band to “find a personality-identity that wasn't as evident when we started the production process,&quot; while also praising Ramsay for his production efforts.  Ramsay took charge of four songs on the finished record. “Josh is really about capturing the emotion and power which isn't surprising considering all the feeling in the writing,” he says. &#xA;&#xA;Oddly enough, Ramsay also wanted Disney's in-house genius Alan (Little Mermaid) Mencken to twiddle the knobs for the climactic version of &quot;Masterpiece Theatre&quot;, but admits, &quot;it's a pretty tall order to get an Academy Award winner to come and work on your record.&quot;&#xA;&#xA;Still, the album is certainly not diminished by the few things Ramsay didn't get. And once the world gets a load of this Masterpiece, Mencken, Pharrell Williams, Phil Spector... you name it. They'll probably be lining up.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;   &#xA;User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL." index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/2924/thumb?t=1344380768" addedAt="1344380189" updatedAt="1344380768">

Songfacts reports that their 2011 single, Moves Like Jagger, topped the American charts and sold over a million copies in just over 20 weeks in the UK, despite failing to top the chart there. &#xA;&#xA;Maroon 5 has won several awards for its debut album Songs About Jane. Released in June 2002, the album enjoyed major chart success, going gold, platinum, and triple platinum in many countries around the world. In support of Songs About Jane, Maroon 5 toured extensively throughout 2003 – 2005, in which a live album was released, entitled Live - Friday the 13th. Original member Ryan Dusick left the band in September 2006, due to injuries sustained by the constant touring, and was replaced by Matt Flynn.&#xA;&#xA;After a hiatus from the music scene, Maroon 5 released their second studio album, It Won't Be Soon Before Long in May 2007, five years after Songs About Jane. The second set debuted at #1 on the Billboard 200 with first week sales of nearly half a million.

The band have been well received in many countries.&#xA;&#xA;The current members of the band are Rob Thomas (vocals, piano), Paul Doucette (drums, now guitar), Kyle Cook (lead guitar, vocals) and Brian Yale (bass). Adam Gaynor (rhythm guitar), who has left the band, performed on all three of their albums, as well. Rob Thomas is the principal songwriter and lead singer. &#xA;&#xA;Thomas, Yale and Doucette performed in the band Tabitha's Secret out of Orlando, Florida before splitting apart to form Matchbox Twenty with Cook and Gaynor.&#xA;&#xA;Matchbox Twenty released their first album, Yourself or Someone Like You in 1996. While their first single, &quot;Long Day&quot;, was a rock radio-only smash, the album soon spun off several Top 40 hit singles throughout 1997 and 1998, including &quot;Push&quot;, &quot;3 A.M.&quot;, &quot;Real World&quot; and &quot;Back 2 Good&quot;. The album eventually went on to sell over 12 million copies in the U.S. alone, earning diamond status. The band toured relentlessly for several years, performing the songs from their one and only album, along with some beloved cover songs such as Cyndi Lauper's &quot;Time After Time&quot; and The Beatles' &quot;Don't Let Me Down&quot;. Their fan base grew from concert to concert because of their electrifying live performances and the longevity of their hit singles on radio. The same year, Matchbox Twenty recorded a live version of their Top-40 hit &quot;3 A.M.&quot; for release on the charity album Live in the X Lounge, benefiting cerebral palsy research.&#xA;&#xA;Before recording their second album, Rob Thomas collaborated with Itaal Shur on a song entitled &quot;Smooth&quot; for Carlos Santana's comeback album, Supernatural. The song had a pop-tinged Latin beat and showcased Thomas' lyrical talents. Thomas was supposed to act solely as songwriter on &quot;Smooth&quot;, but Carlos Santana had him sing on it as well after hearing the song's demo recording. &quot;Smooth&quot;, was the album's lead single and became a gigantic hit in 1999; Thomas earned three Grammys for writing and performing on &quot;Smooth&quot;, including Record of the Year and Song of the Year.&#xA;&#xA;In 2000, Matchbox 20 renamed themselves Matchbox Twenty and released their second album, Mad Season. The album featured lush instrumental arrangements and spun off several hit singles, including &quot;Bent&quot; (Number One on Hot 100) and &quot;If You're Gone&quot;. The video for &quot;Bent&quot;, poked fun of singer Thomas' heightened profile from &quot;Smooth&quot; by showing the other band members assaulting him mercilessly. The evocatively arranged ballad &quot;If You're Gone&quot; became a big hit, especially on adult contemporary formats. The band's next two singles, &quot;Mad Season&quot; and &quot;Last Beautiful Girl&quot; were not particularly successful.  Fans also note hearing &quot;Black &amp; White People&quot; receive radio play, despite not being released as a single.&#xA;&#xA;For their third album, More Than You Think You Are, the band returned to a harder rock sound. Thomas shared the songwriting efforts with the other band members on several songs. The album spun off hit singles &quot;Disease&quot;, &quot;Unwell&quot;, and &quot;Bright Lights&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;In May 2004, the band released a live concert DVD, Show: A Night in the Life of Matchbox Twenty, filmed in Atlanta and featuring 20 songs, including all of their hit singles.&#xA;&#xA;In February 2005, rhythm guitarist Gaynor officially left the group, which had been on hiatus to allow other members to pursue side projects. Rob Thomas went on to release a solo album entitled ...Something to Be which became the U.S. Billboard 200 #1 album the first week of its release. The album featured four hit singles: &quot;Lonely No More&quot;, &quot;This Is How a Heart Breaks&quot;, &quot;Ever The Same&quot; and &quot;Streetcorner Symphony&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;In January 2007, Rob Thomas released a single entitled &quot;Little Wonders&quot; which he wrote for the Disney movie Meet the Robinsons.&#xA;&#xA;On April 20, 2007, the Daily Intelligencer reported that Matchbox Twenty will start working on their next album on April 23, 2007, in an article about Rob Thomas' documentary, My Secret Record.&#xA;&#xA;Their  &quot;Exile On Mainstream&quot; album was released on October 2, 2007 and is a two disc set.  The first disc features 6 new songs, including the hit &quot;How Far We've Come&quot;, which can be heard on the website, along with the music video.

Joules Scott-Key and Joshua Winstead have their own side project, Bang Lime. Emily Haines released her debut album Cut In Half and Also Double in 1996 and two records under the moniker Emily Haines &amp; The Soft Skeleton: the album Knives Don't Have Your Back in 2006 and the 6-track EP What Is Free To A Good Home? in 2007. She also has been a guest on albums by Stars, The Crystal Method, kc accidental, Delerium, The Stills and Jason Collett.&#xA;&#xA;Emily Haines was born in New Delhi, India and raised since the age of 3 in Peterborough, Ontario. The daughter of poet Paul Haines grew up as a dual citizen of Canada and India. Her father would often make cassettes of rare and eclectic music for his daughter to listen to and her early influences included Carla Bley and Robert Wyatt. By her teens she followed her parents' footsteps by attending the Etobicoke School of the Arts. There she met Amy Millan and Kevin Drew, with whom she would later collaborate in hHead. Haines and Millan briefly formed their first band around 1990 while at ESA and with songs later written and recorded while at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver in 1992–1993, at Toronto in 1995 and at Concordia University in Montreal in 1995–1996, Haines distributed in 1996 an early effort called Cut In Half and Also Double with a limited number of copies.&#xA;&#xA;James Shaw was born in the UK. He was a student at a Boston music school and was friends with Torquil Campbell, a vocalist who would later form Stars and Chris Seligman, the future synthesizer player of Stars. Torquil had plans to move to New York City and on his suggestion Shaw applied to Juilliard Music School and moved to New York with him. In 1998, Shaw and Torquil returned to Toronto, where Haines met Shaw through mutual friends in the local music scene. Shaw moved to Montreal where Haines was still living and the two worked on filling out each other's projects. The first song made by Shaw and Haines was &quot;Butcher&quot; and eventually they had completed in 1998 several other tracks in their home studio, gathered on Mainstream EP, a collection of demos with an overall downtempo and electronic feel.&#xA;&#xA;In the fall of 1998, Shaw moved back to New York City, this time accompanied by Haines, Campbell and Seligman. There they shared a loft in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn. During their two-year stay at the loft, Haines and Shaw were erstwhile room mates with future members of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Liars and TV on the Radio. &#xA;&#xA;Haines and Shaw set off to London in early 2000 and signed a publishing deal with Chrysalis Records. With the help of producer Stephen Hague, Metric worked on a new batch of New Wave/electropop drum-machine paced songs that would form the nucleus of their debut album. The effort dubbed Grow Up And Blow Away, revealed a more musically-layered and mature sound than the earlier Mainstream EP. Haines and Shaw completed the album in April 2001 and by this time had found a label for their release, Restless Records. The album was delayed for years by their record label. &#xA;&#xA;The band performed in New York in early Spring and late Summer 2001, personally circulating handmade CD-R copies of their unreleased music to fans at shows and by mail, eventually giving the music away for free on the internet. Metric at the time was for the most part a studio band and live shows approximated the synthesizer-centered and drum-machine driven sound of the recordings. In the same year they issued a 5-track EP entitled Static Anonymity and two promo singles: &quot;Grow Up and Blow Away&quot; and &quot;Raw Sugar&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;In the winter of 2001, Metric had gained two new bandmates: the drummer Joules Scott-Key (born in Flint, Michigan) and the bass player Joshua Winstead. Joules Scott-Key was attending college in Texas was in town with his friend Joshua Winstead performing in the local music scene. Scott-Key and Winstead had known each other for about a decade and they met Shaw and Haines at the Brooklyn loft and at local performances.&#xA;&#xA;On 2 September 2003, Metric released their first official studio album Old World Underground, Where Are You Now? on Last Gang Records. The album was received with positive reviews and it has gone gold in Canada. They released 3 singles from the album: &quot;Combat Baby&quot; (6 December 2004), &quot;Succexy&quot; (2004) and &quot;Dead Disco&quot; (2004). The song &quot;Combat Baby&quot; appeared in the music game Rock Band 3.&#xA;&#xA;On 27 September 2005, the band released their second studio album, Live It Out on Last Gang Records. The album was well received and has since gone twice platinum in Canada, selling over 200,000 units. They issued 4 singles: &quot;Monster Hospital&quot; (7 August 2006; #1 CAN, #55 UK), &quot;Poster Of A Girl&quot; (15 May 2006; #3 CAN), &quot;Handshakes&quot; (promo only; #17 CAN) and &quot;Empty&quot; (12 February 2007). During this time, Metric was approached by and agreed to open for The Rolling Stones whose tour coincided with theirs in New York City. The band has toured the world extensively for several years playing concerts in UK, France, Germany, Iceland, Brazil, Greece, Italy, Turkey, Holland, Finland, Belgium, Sweden, Norway, United States, Canada, Venezuela, Mexico and Japan.&#xA;&#xA;On 26 June 2007, Last Gang Records released Metric's 2001 album Grow Up and Blow Away, after purchasing the rights to the album from band's previous label. In 2007 they released a live EP entitled Live At Metropolis followed a year later by a DVD with the same name featuring a concert recorded from Montreal.&#xA;&#xA;On 7 April 2009, Metric released their fourth album Fantasies on their own label, Metric Music International. In the US it debuted at #1 on Billboard's Top Heatseekers and peaked at #76 on the Billboard 200, in Canada it debuted at #13 on the Canadian Albums Chart and peaked at #6 and in Australia, the album debuted at #48. The album received mostly positive reviews and it's their most successful record to date. They released 5 singles: &quot;Help I'm Alive&quot; (23 December 2008 Canada, 1 January 2010 worldwide; #21 CAN, #17 US Alt. Songs, #29 US Rock Songs), &quot;Front Row&quot; (promo only, 12 March 2009; #65 CAN), &quot;Gimme Sympathy&quot; (radio promo, 12 March 2009; #52 CAN), &quot;Sick Muse&quot; (1 June 2009) and &quot;Gold Guns Girls&quot; (promo only, December 2009). &#xA;&#xA;Amazon.com listed Fantasies in eleventh in its &quot;Best Albums of 2009&quot; list. This album was a shortlisted nominee for the 2009 Polaris Music Prize and also won two Casby Awards, the NXNE favourite new indie release award and favourite new album award. On 18 April 2010, the album won the Juno Award for Alternative Album of the Year at the 2010 Awards, as well as the band winning Group of the Year.&#xA;&#xA;On 27 October 2009, Metric released a 5-track EP called Plug In Plug Out containing acoustic versions of five songs from Fantasies. During the 2010 Winter Olympics, Metric, along with several other Canadian music acts, came together in Vancouver to re-record K'Naan's song &quot;Wavin' Flag&quot; to benefit Haiti in a movement called Young Artists for Haiti. &#xA;&#xA;In 2010, the band contributed to Twilight: Eclipse movie soundtrack with a song entitled &quot;Eclipse (All Yours)&quot;. In the same year, a previously unreleased song &quot;Black Sheep&quot; was used on the soundtrack of the movie Scott Pilgrim vs. the World. In 2011, Metric issued the live EP iTunes Session.&#xA;&#xA;Official site: http://www.ilovemetric.com&#xA;   &#xA;User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL." index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/4087/thumb?t=1344380783" art="/library/metadata/4087/art?t=1344380783" addedAt="1344380327" updatedAt="1344380783">

			<Directory ratingKey="4099" key="/library/metadata/4099/children" type="artist" title="Mindless Self Indulgence" summary="Mindless Self Indulgence (or MSI) is an American industrial jungle pussy punk (as described by them) band that found its origin in New York City, NY in 1997. The current lineup is Jimmy Urine (vocals), Steve Righ? (guitar), Lyn-Z (bass) and Kitty (drums). Though considered electropunk, they are heavily influenced by jungle, industrial, electronic dance music, and hip-hop. Intentionally iconoclastic, James Euringer (who uses the stage name [bandmember from=1997]Little Jimmy Urine) owes sartorial influence to the New York Dolls, wearing fishnet shirts at concerts, and is occasionally seen in shorts or pants with the inside cut out similar to how a skirt looks, and neon stockings. &#xA;&#xA;Before starting the band Mindless Self Indulgence, james euringer launched a solo album in 1995, called Mindless Self-Indulgence, which he had produced by himself and was limited to 500 copies. Contrary to popular belief, this was not an album by the band Mindless Self Indulgence, however, Steve Righ? played guitar for the track &quot;Bed of Roses&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;Another large influence in the band's music comes from early 1980s culture. Frequently the music contains samples of early 80's hip-hop or rock, as well as Atari-style beeps and tones. Their second album as a band, 1999's Tight, was even allegedly mixed on Atari equipment. Many of Urine's dress styles consist of the juxtaposition of popular 1980s clothing or bastardized versions thereof.&#xA;&#xA;Later in 1999, MSI launched the album Frankenstein Girls Will Seem Strangely Sexy, featuring 30 tracks that were sorted alphabetically. Kitty (Drummer) designed and ran the official site of MSI when the album came out.&#xA;&#xA;After Frankenstein Girls Will Seem Strangely Sexy , Vanessa YT (Bass player) decided to leave MSI to start a family. Her replacement in the band was Lyn-Z (Bass player), who married My Chemical Romance's lead singer Gerard Way in September 2007.&#xA;&#xA;Mindless Self Indulgence is distinguished from mainstream punk, however, by their incorporating lyrics about being gay and related topics into nearly all of their songs - even titling one of their songs Faggot. Also, Euringer and Steve, Righ? (Guitarist) possess wide vocal ranges, stretching from tenor to high falsetto. The band also has no qualms about using words deemed offensive by some, such as nigga (Jimmy Urine argues that he doesn't say the word out of anger, and often it is more or less used in the sense that it is used in the hip-hop world), and faggot heavily in many of their songs. Many critics have used their word choice to dismiss the band as juvenile.&#xA;&#xA;And although this may be the case, with some songs being of a 'juvenile' subject and tone, they also use clever lyrics and stance to give meaning to songs, such as You'll rebel to anything, which is a song that talks about how punk culture is being exploited by misdirected youths as a way to be unique or get noticed.&#xA;&#xA;In keeping with their confrontational posture, Euringer has been arrested for pulling his penis out of his pants and attempting to set his pubic hair on fire, allegedly succeeding on one such occasion. Other notable stage antics include him drinking his own urine, inviting audience members to punch him in the face and/or throw objects at him, making out with both genders during the show, and roaming through the audience after the set blaring hip-hop music from a boom box perched on his shoulder.&#xA;&#xA;The band's energetic live shows have gained them much recognition. The band is known to stay after the show has finished, signing whatever fans want until not one person is left wanting an autograph. They also take photographs with all desiring fans. They have opened for a number of popular bands, including System of a Down, Korn, Staind, Sum 41, Mushroomhead, Insane Clown Posse, My Chemical Romance, and Rammstein. They have also played many large musical festivals including Voodoo Music Experience in New Orleans in October of 2003 (and in Memphis, TN after Hurricane Katrina in 2006), as well as headlining the Mojave tent at the 2004 Coachella Festival, and the main stage of 2007's Give It A Name. They also headlined the second stage of the Projekt Revolution tour in Summer 2007.&#xA;&#xA;Their DVD, called Our Pain, Your Gain, was released on September 11, 2007, featuring one of their concerts in New York.&#xA;&#xA;On 29th April 2008, their 4th studio album, If, was released. The standard edition contains 15 tracks, the deluxe edition has the same tracklist and a bonus DVD. The Clean version has 16 tracks, Uncle being the additional track. The International edition (UK version) has 21 tracks; 3S as bonus track and four Never Wanted To Dance remixes.&#xA;   &#xA;User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL." index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/4099/thumb?t=1344380792" art="/library/metadata/4099/art?t=1344380792" addedAt="1344380330" updatedAt="1344380792">

Formed in January 2000, they are known for their video game based songs, which are instrumental rock variations of classic NES video game music from games such as Mega Man, Metroid and Castlevania. Minibosses have managed to form a growing following amongst video game fans, and allow fans to download several free songs off their website. Much of their following has come from their constant playing of concerts at local clubs around Arizona and other cities in the southwest. Fans refer to themselves as &quot;Minibossies&quot; and are known to travel great lengths to see the band. The band has also formed quite a following on their web forums, which is host to most tour announcements, new video game covers from other remixers, and the Dwelling of Duels competition.&#xA;&#xA;There are a various video game song remixes floating around the Internet that are falsely attributed (perhaps by mistaken fans) to Minibosses. These include a remix of the theme from the first level of Doom, and the Tetris theme (which is actually the Russian folk song &quot;Korobeiniki&quot;) by Ozma, among many others. Minibosses only cover NES game music.&#xA;&#xA;Neskimos songs are also very frequently mistaken for Minibosses songs.  &quot;The Advantage&quot; also does covers of Nintendo Theme music, and could be confused with &quot;The Minibosses.&quot;&#xA;&#xA;The Minibosses are currently Ben Baraldi — vocals, bass; Aaron Burke — guitar; John Lipfert — guitar; and Matt Wood — drums.

			<Directory ratingKey="4173" key="/library/metadata/4173/children" type="artist" title="Muse" summary="Muse is an alternative rock band from Teignmouth, England, United Kingdom. The band consists of Matthew Bellamy on lead vocals, piano, keyboard and guitar, Chris Wolstenholme on backing vocals and bass guitar, and Dominic Howard on drums and percussion.  &#xA;&#xA;They have been friends since their formation in early 1994 and changed band names a number of times (such as Gothic Plague, Fixed Penalty, and Rocket Baby Dolls) before adopting the name Muse. Since the release of their fourth album, Morgan Nicholls has also appeared with the band at live performances to provide keyboards, samples/synth, and backing vocals.&#xA;&#xA;Their sound is a blend of alternative rock, classical music, electronica, metal, spanish guitars, and progressive rock. Usually they use the bass line as the driving force, often with the guitar providing only an extra layer to the song rather than carrying the melody, the bass has distortion and other effects applied to it to achieve a greater weight, allowing the guitar to digress from the main tune and play higher notes. Another peculiarity is Muse´s piano style in many of their songs; their music has been inspired by the works of Romantic pianist-composers such as Rachmaninoff, Tchaikovsky and Liszt, and has thus resulted in a fusion of Romantic style with modern rock.&#xA;&#xA;The band is known for their energetic live performances and front man Matthew Bellamy's eccentric and avid interests in global conspiracy, extraterrestrial life, theology and the apocalypse (as much as in Space and theoretical physics). Their lyrical themes involve madcap conspiracy theory, revolutionary rabble-rousing, weird stuff about aliens (or Zetas, if you please), religions and other such classic Muse concerns. In general their music and lyrics gaze on helplessly at the subjugation of humanity by corrupt world leaders and encroaching environmental or galactic disasters (and certainly their last album 'Black Holes And Revelations' has its fair share of climate change/oil crisis/global inflagration paranoia). &#xA;&#xA;In October 1999, Muse released their first full length LP; 'Showbiz'. The album received mixed reviews among critics, and music fans, labeling the band as 'Radiohead copycats'. This, however, did not stop the album from selling over 700,000 copies, with success coming from singles; Unintended and Muscle Museum. The album also earned Muse a nomination at the 2000 BRIT Awards, for Best New Act.&#xA;&#xA;2001, with John Leckie behind the desk again, saw the release of Origin of Symmetry along with Top 20 entries for Plug in Baby and New Born. The album went unreleased in the United States until 2005 because their record label at the time, Madonna's Maverick, allegedly thought the falsetto vocals would discourage radio play and wanted the band to re-record alternate vocals.  The band refused, and terminated its contract with Maverick.&#xA;&#xA;Muse followed up with a b-side/live CD/DVD named Hullabaloo Soundtrack, showcasing the band's concert from France in late 2001. To promote the album, Muse also released the Dead Star/In Your World EP, which charted high in the UK charts and proving Muse could also write &quot;radio-friendly&quot; rock tunes, as well as the 7 minute long epics on Origin of Symmetry. Muse polished off their impressive year by winning Best Live Band at the 2002 Kerrang! Awards.&#xA;&#xA;In 2003, Muse asked Rich Costey to step behind the desk to help create Absolution. The album had very strong sales all over the world, and helped the band achieve their first UK number 1 album. Its release was preceded by a download-only single and online video for the song Stockholm Syndrome. Followed by the singles Time is Running Out and Hysteria, which charted well in the UK charts and helped Muse secure a headline spot at the 2004 Glastonbury Festival.&#xA;&#xA;Glastonbury saw Muse storm troop onto the high table of classic Glastonbury headline acts and prove themselves a formidable force in British rock.  Although many had their doubts at putting Muse on the bill with names such as Paul McCartney, Muse proved them all wrong and played what Bellamy described as &quot;the best gig of our lives.&quot; It was only with that triumph fresh in their throats, they claim, that they realised they'd 'made it'.  However tragedy struck just shortly after Muse came off stage when Dom Howard's father (a big Muse fan) collapsed after witnessing his son play and died on the site.&#xA;&#xA;Later that year, Muse toured the US, promoting Absolution, before returning home to play two sell-out gigs at London's Earls Court at the end of the year.&#xA;&#xA;In 2006 and after a long and exhaustive tour, the band returned to the studio, and released Black Holes and Revelations.Interview with Dominic 2006&#xA;&#xA;With the LP, the band secured their second UK album chart number one, whilst reaching the top spot in several other countries, as well as a Top 10 in the US billboard chart. The controversial single Supermassive Black Hole became Muse's highest UK entry in the charts, reaching number four, and also scored high entries in other countries. The album's second single, Starlight, reached number 13 in the UK charts in September 2006. The 3rd UK single was fan-favourite Knights of Cydonia, released on November 27th, and it reached number 10 in the UK charts. The 4th single from Black Holes &amp; Revelations was Invincible, and was released April 15th 2007. It entered the UK singles chart at 21st place, and was the first single from the new album not to enter in the Top 20. On November 2, 2006, the band won an award for Best Alternative Act at the annual MTV EMA in Copenhagen. Muse were also named 'Best Live Act' at the Brit Awards in 2006 and have retained the title in 2007.&#xA;&#xA;Two of the album's singles reached the highest US Modern Rock chart positions in the band's career during 2007: Starlight reached #2 in February 2007, and the all-falsetto Supermassive Black Hole reached #6 in October.  2007 also saw the band play to sellouts at Madison Square Garden and the Forum in Los Angeles, as well as headlining Austin City Limits Festival and Lollapalooza.&#xA;&#xA;Even when the band says they do not see themselves as a massive stadium band, their headline concert on June 16th 2007, at the rebuilt Wembley Stadium, sold out in 45 minutes six months before the gig and the band had to add a second show on June 17, where they proved to be more than worthy of stadium gigs.  The Wembley gigs became two of the biggest hyped concerts of 2007.  Already the gigs have been compared by music journalists to Live Aid and Queen gigs, also performed on the &quot;Hallowed Ground.&quot;  The band's next release, HAARP: Live from Wembley, is expected to be made up of footage from the June 17th show.&#xA;&#xA;In July 2007, Bellamy confirmed that he has begun to work on a new studio album and new songs, some more in line with electronic or &quot;dance&quot; music and others more with classical or symphonic music. The band is also thinking of hiring an orchestra for some of them. He also revealed that the next album should be self-produced, in order to have more freedom.&#xA;&#xA;In January 2008 the song &quot;Knights of Cydonia&quot; was voted number 1 on the Triple J Hottest 100, Australia's biggest annual alternative music countdown.&#xA;&#xA;In 2009, the band released The Resistance, which contained the successful single &quot;Uprising&quot;, the band's first Top 40 pop hit in the United States (achieving this with very little radio airplay) and their first #1 on the Billboard Modern Rock Chart. Followup singles &quot;Resistance&quot; and &quot;Undisclosed Desires&quot; also proved successful. &#xA;&#xA;The band's sixth album, &quot;The 2nd Law&quot;, will be released on 1 October 2012. The album's first single, &quot;Survival&quot;, is the official song of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London.&#xA;   &#xA;User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL." index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/4173/thumb?t=1344380817" addedAt="1344380338" updatedAt="1344380817">

			<Directory ratingKey="4587" key="/library/metadata/4587/children" type="artist" title="Panic! At the Disco" summary="Panic! At the Disco is currently a two-piece rock band hailing from Las Vegas, Nevada. The current members are vocalist/multi-instrumentalist Brendon Urie and drummer Spencer Smith. Their debut album A Fever You Can't Sweat Out has sold over 2.2 million copies worldwide, 1.5 million of which were in the United States alone. This shot them into the international spotlight. Their sophomore album Pretty. Odd. debuted at number 2 on the Billboard 200.  The band released their third album, entitled Vices &amp; Virtues, on March 22, 2011, while the record's first single, &quot;The Ballad Of Mona Lisa&quot; was released February 1, 2011.&#xA;&#xA;Although the band officially formed as Panic! at the Disco in 2004, the first incarnation of the band was formed in 2002 under the name &quot;Pet Salamander&quot;, with Ryan Ross, Spencer Smith, Brent Wilson, and Trevor Howell. It was during this time that Ryan Ross wrote &quot;Time To Dance&quot; and &quot;I Write Sins Not Tragedies&quot;, so some consider the band to have formed as of 2002.&#xA;&#xA;In 2005, Panic! at the Disco, which at the time included Urie, Smith, guitarist/lyricist Ryan Ross, and bassist Brent Wilson, was discovered by Pete Wentz of Fall Out Boy, who, after hearing demos the band uploaded to PureVolume went to Las Vegas to hear the band play in their garage. He immediately signed them to his Fueled By Ramen label imprint Decaydance. After their debut A Fever You Can't Sweat Out was released, bassist Brent Wilson left the band. Although he claims he was fired, the other members deny this.&#xA;&#xA;The success of their first two singles helped catapult their debut album to the top of the Billboard Independent chart and to #13 on the Billboard 200 in July 2006. With Jon Walker filling in as temporary bassist, the band embarked on their first headlining tour through Europe. All of the dates sold out within hours. Immediately after returning, they did the same in North America. On July 3, Jon Walker became the permanent bassist of Panic! at the Disco.&#xA;&#xA;In early 2007, Panic! at the Disco began writing their follow up album but, after months of work, decided to rewrite the entire album from scratch in July 2007. While speaking to MTV, Ryan Ross explained that, before the decision to start over was made, the album had lacked a band set up and that it &quot;sounded like a film score.&quot; He also explained that the new songs have &quot;a more positive outlook to them.&quot; On January 9, the exclamation point (!) in the band's name was dropped. They defended the decision to drop the exclamation point during an interview with MTV: &quot;It was never part of the name to us. (...) When we started doing new promo stuff for this album, we just told everyone not to use it anymore.&quot; Panic (sans &quot;!&quot;) later confirmed that the second album was titled Pretty. Odd. with a release date of March 25, 2008.&#xA;&#xA;On July 6th, 2009, an announcement was put up on the band's official website and myspace page, stating that Ryan Ross and Jon Walker would be leaving the band to pursue their own musical interests. They have since formed the band The Young Veins. &#xA;&#xA;Brendon Urie and Spencer Smith, however, will stay and continue playing as Panic! at the Disco, with the exclamation point re-added. Fans can hear a snippet of Panic!'s demo entitled &quot;Oh Glory&quot; on the band's official website. &#xA;&#xA;Since the split, Panic! at the Disco joined Fall Out Boy, Blink-182, and Chester French on the first half of Blink-182's summer tour in 2009. They brought along Ian Crawford formerly of The Cab and Dallon Weekes of The Brobecks to temporarily replace Ross and Walker. The band also released a single titled New Perspective which was featured on the Jennifer's Body Soundtrack in August 2009.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;New Perspective&quot; was released on July 28, 2009.[26] Former The Cab member Ian Crawford filled in for Ross on their tour during the summer of 2009. Dallon Weekes, singer/songwriter of the indie band The Brobecks, filled in for Walker on bass on the tour as well.[27]&#xA;&#xA;The band re-entered the studio during early 2010 and spent much of the year recording their third studio album.[20] On January 18, 2011, the band revealed that their new album, Vices &amp; Virtues, would officially be released on March 22, 2011. The album was produced by Butch Walker and John Feldmann.[28] The record's first single, &quot;The Ballad of Mona Lisa&quot;, was released digitally on February 1, 2011, with the music video being released February 8, 2011. The band played 2 new, unheard songs &quot;Nearly Witches (Ever Since We Met...)&quot; and &quot;Let's Kill Tonight&quot; at recent concerts.

The band's lineup has no permanent drummer or keyboardist.&#xA;&#xA;Phoenix formed in 1999 and started off as the backing band for a remix of Air’s “Kelly Watch the Stars” single. Soon after, Phoenix released their debut album United in 2000. The name &quot;Phoenix&quot; was officially chosen in 1996 when Laurent Brancowitz permanently joined Pheonix after his other band Darlin' disbanded. The other two members of Darlin' (Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo) went on to form Daft Punk.&#xA;&#xA;Phoenix are based in Paris, France and their music has been featured in such films as Shallow Hal and Lost In Translation.

The album won for Best Alternative Album at the 52nd Annual GRAMMY Awards.&#xA;&#xA;Phoenix (2)&#xA;A Romanian folk rock / rock band, who has experimented across the years with many musical genres, having a rich musical history that can easily be compared to that of the Beatles. Starting with the rock’n’roll of the Beat Generation, they continued enriching their sound with blues influences, jazz, psychedelic, krautrock, culminating with the orientation towards Romanian folk music, which they blended harmoniously with the sound that was popular in the ’70s&#xA;&#xA;Full bio:&#xA;&#xA;Phoenix is one of the most prominent Romanian Rock and Roll bands of the latest decades, and also the first one to take musical inspiration from ancient Romanian folk themes.&#xA;&#xA;Formed in the 1960s, it began by doing covers of Beatles songs. However, they soon had to change their style since the Romanian communist regime disliked any form of western culture. The communist regime suggested that all rock oriented bands should look for inspiration within the Romanian culture. These restrictions made the band’s leader Nicolae Covaci search within the Romanian folklore, which gave them a unique sound.&#xA;&#xA;The beginning&#xA;&#xA;Phoenix was launched in the cosmopolitan city of Timişoara in 1962 by a pair of schoolboys: Nicu Covaci and Béla Kamocsa, under the name of Sfinţii (The Saints). In their first years, together with Florin “Moni” Bordeianu (born 1948), they performed in school contests and at local clubs, covering Western music hits from The Rolling Stones, The Beatles, The Who, etc., and they quickly became very popular amongst the youth. In 1965 the Communist authorities demanded that the band stop performing under the name The Saints, because of the religious innuendo that the name carried. Forced to comply, the band took the name Phoenix. Nicu Covaci also changed the composition of the band, around 1963, by adding Claudiu Rotaru, Ioan “Pilu” Ştefanovici (born 1946) and Günther “Spitzly” Reininger (born 1950) to the lineup.&#xA;&#xA;In 1965 they had their first big concert in Bucharest. Their performance brought a collaboration with Cornel Chiriac to record some of their songs. The first songs they recorded were “Ştiu cǎ mǎ iubesti şi tu” (“I Know You Love Me Too”), “Dunăre, Dunăre” (“Danube, Danube”) and “Bun e vinul ghiurghiuliu” (“Good is the Red Wine”). The same year also marked the beginning of their collaboration with Victor Cârcu, who went on to write many of their most famous songs, such as “Vremuri” (“Old Times”), “Şi totuşi ca voi sunt” (“And Yet I Am Like You”), “Nebunul cu ochii închişi” (“Crazy Man with closed eyes”), “Floarea stîncilor” (“Mountain Flower”) and “Canarul” (“Canary”).&#xA;&#xA;In December 1967 Phoenix had their first major series of concerts in many western cities, capped off by two huge concerts in Timişoara. After winning a few prizes in national students’ contests, held at Iaşi the following year, in 1968 they recorded their first EP, Vremuri (Old Times), containing two original songs, Vremuri and Canarul (The Canary), and two covers (Lady Madonna - The Beatles and Friday on my Mind - Easybeats). A second EP would follow one year later, named Floarea stîncilor (The Flower of the Rocks), with all four songs being original compositions. Both albums sport a sound reminiscent of the beat style popular in that era.&#xA;&#xA;They then started working on a rock theater play “Omul 36/80” (The Man 36/80) which won several prizes for originality.&#xA;&#xA;In 1969 Ioan “Pilu” Ştefanovici was replaced by Dorel “Baba” Vintilă Zaharia (born 1943). For the next year the band became more and more popular, frequently visiting Bucharest and being invited in talk shows about music.&#xA;&#xA;In 1970, Moni Bordeianu emigrated to the US, and, for a brief period of time the band suspended its activity, also due to total censorship that followed a protesting speech held by Bordeianu in his last concert. 1970 meant the blues period of the band. The formula used was Nicu Covaci - guitar, Günther “Spitzly” Reininger - piano and voice, Zoltan Covacs - bass guitar and Liviu Butoi - oboe and flute. Phoenix was born again the next year, with Covaci, Josef Kappl, Mircea Baniciu, Costin Petrescu (replaced in 1974 by Ovidiu Lipan, nicknamed “Ţăndărică”) and Valeriu Sepi.&#xA;&#xA;But the Communist officials were not very comfortable with the Western-style music that they were singing, and kept creating them problems. So Phoenix abandoned beat turned to Romanian folklore, pagan rituals, mystic animals and old traditions. In this same year, Phoenix started a collaboration with the Institute of Ethnography and Folklore and the Folklore section of Timişoara University on an ambitious project, a rock poem that combined traditional wooden instruments with modern sounds. During this project the band also started collaborating with Valeriu Sepi (born 1947), who eventually joined the band. The first outcome would be the 1972 LP Cei ce ne-au dat nume (Those Who Gave Us Our Names) - the first LP to be recorded in Romania by a Romanian band. Two years later, Mugur de fluier (Flute Bud) followed. Both albums underwent severe censorship.&#xA;&#xA;In 1973 Phoenix represented Romania at the “Golden harp” festival in Bratislava (Slovakia) and then in the “Disc festival” in Sopot (Poland). Also, they wanted to record a new rock-opera, named “Meşterul Manole”, but the communist officials censored it all, by “losing” the unique book with costume sketches and lyrics given to them for official approval. The result was only a EP with an extract from the opera, Meşterul Manole, uvertură (Meşterul Manole, uverture) and two older songs, Mamă, Mamă (Mother, Mother) and Te întreb pe tine, soare… (I’m asking you, sun…).&#xA;&#xA;On Monday, 19 November 1973, Phoenix held a memorable concert in Bucharest, presenting their new hits “Andri Popa”, “Pavel Chinezu” and “Strunga”, which composed the new disc “Mugur de fluier”. The new songs were still influenced by folklore yet had a new style. This style was the result of the collaboration with new songwriters Andrei Ujică and Şerban Foarţă. Based on those new songs Nicu Covaci created a new show “Introducere la un concert despre muzica veche la români” (“Introduction to a concert about old Romanian music”) in which he introduced violins, flutes, archaic percussion and other traditional instruments. The show was never finished due to a new collaboration with “Cenaclul Flacăra.” This period is considered the peak for Phoenix. Their sound was considered original and powerful and full stadiums were common for their concerts.&#xA;&#xA;Every winter the members of the band would retreat to Mount Semenic and plan their upcoming songs. That winter the show “Zoosophia”, a title that would later change to “Cantafabule”, was created. The show began by “calling” all mythic animals and continued by dedicating a song to each of them, finishing with the Phoenix, the band’s symbol. The year 1975 brought a newcomer to the band, Ovidiu Lipan “Ţăndărică” (born 1953). The “Cantafabule” show was first presented in Timişoara in February 1975. The disc was recorded in a very short time and was published the same year with a misspelling in the title: “Cantofabule.” What followed were two years of almost continuous concerts but also the creation of the soundtrack for the movie “Nemuritorii”.&#xA;&#xA;By this time, the popularity of Phoenix had grown huge; people loved their songs not only for what they were, but also because they contained thinly-veiled allusions to the Communist regime. The band members, especially Nicu Covaci, found themselves increasingly harassed by the Securitate. Covaci married a Dutch woman and left the country in 1976. He returned in 1977, bringing in relief aid for those struck by the powerful earthquake on March 4. After two grandiose concerts in Constanţa and Tulcea, Covaci surprisingly left the country again, this time with all the band members (except Baniciu) hidden inside their Marshall speakers - a huge undertaking, since in Communist Romania it was extremely difficult to obtain approval to travel abroad, and illegal border crossing was punished with imprisonment.&#xA;&#xA;After arriving in Germany, Phoenix disbanded. Kappl and a few others (Erlend Krauser, Ovidiu Lipan) formed a new band, Madhouse and released a not very successful album named From The East. In 1981, Covaci co-opted Neumann and Lipan and English bassist Tom Buggie, who had an amazing technical playing ability, under the name Transsylvania Phoenix (since a band named Phoenix already existed) and released an LP named Transsylvania, containing two old Phoenix songs translated into English to target the Western audience and five new ones. Covaci together with Kappl also released two EPs and one maxi single as Transsylvania-Phoenix.&#xA;&#xA;In 1990 Phoenix made a triumphant comeback to Romania, with a highly emotional concert in their hometown Timişoara, the city that sparked the popular revolt in December 1989 that eventually led to the downfall of the Communist regime. In the following years, Phoenix toured a lot and released a few compilations of their older recordings. Internal frictions, especially between Covaci and Baniciu, were making headlines in the media.&#xA;&#xA;A new album appeared in 2000, the first original album after their 1990 comeback; with the exception of Covaci, the lineup comprised none of the members from the ’70s.&#xA;&#xA;In 2002, the 40th Anniversary of the band brought together almost all former members in a supershow.&#xA;&#xA;At the end of 2005 the band (in its classic gold lineup) released a new album, named Baba Novak.&#xA;&#xA;As of 2008, the band still performs at live events.&#xA;&#xA;Members:&#xA;Nicolae (Nicu) Covaci - Guitar, vocals, composer, founder and leader of the band.

She plays piano and acoustic guitar, and her dark, smokey alto garners frequent comparisons to Fiona Apple. Her first full-length album, Happenstance, was released on June 8, 2004.&#xA;&#xA;Yamagata became the vocalist for the Chicago funk-fusion band Bumpus, spending six years with them while writing and recording three albums and touring the country. However, she began to write songs which took on a style that conflicted with the funk vision of the band. In 2001, Yamagata decided to take those songs and pursue a solo career. In September 2002, she landed a two-record deal with Arista's Private Music label, and her EP was released in October.&#xA;&#xA;She also made an appearance in Jason Mraz's second album, singing a song with him called Did You Get My Message?&#xA;&#xA;She also teamed with with Toots &amp; The Maytals to sing Blame On Me.&#xA;&#xA;She also worked with Ryan Adams &amp; The Cardinals on their first album Cold Roses. On that album, where she is credited as: &quot;Our little sis&quot;, she did some vocals and played &quot;listenable&quot; piano on the tracks 'Let It Ride', 'Cold Roses' and 'Friends'.  &#xA;&#xA;Yamagata sang with Rhett Miller on Fireflies from his 2006 release The Believer.&#xA;&#xA;Her songs have featured on several TV shows, including How I Met Your Mother, ER , Nip/Tuck, Men in Trees, Alias, One Tree Hill, Brothers &amp; Sisters and The O.C., to which she made a guest performance in season 2. Yamagata also contributed a song to Mandy Moore's 2007 album, Wild Hope. She also toured with Moore, opening many of her shows around the country.&#xA;&#xA;On May 22, 2008, a new banner was added to her site indicating the digital release of a new EP, Loose Ends, with three new songs, serving as a preview for the now delayed release of her second full-length album.&#xA;&#xA;In early 2008, her site featured a &quot;teaser video&quot; for the new album. The album was finally released on October 7, 2008. Yamagata's second studio album is called Elephants...Teeth Sinking Into Heart. It was originally slated for release in the late-summer of 2007.&#xA;&#xA;On October 9th, 2008, a two-song live acoustic video performance premiered on LiveDaily Sessions, featuring the songs &quot;Faster&quot; and &quot;Sunday Afternoon&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;Her highly acclaimed CD Cheasapeake premiered on October 11, 2011.

The band currently consists of founding members Anthony Kiedis (vocals) and Michael &quot;Flea&quot; Balzary (bass) along with a longtime member Chad Smith (drums). Guitarist John Frusciante quietly left the band on good terms in late 2008. On January 2, 2010, Josh Klinghoffer was announced as Frusciante's replacement.&#xA;&#xA;The band initially formed for a one-off support act for a friend's band, calling themselves Tony Flow And The Miraculously Majestic Masters Of Mayhem. Upon renaming themselves Red Hot Chili Peppers, they played a handful of small club venues in Los Angeles in 1983, before they were signed to EMI Records.&#xA;&#xA;Current members:&#xA;&#xA;Vocal: Anthony Kiedis (1983-present).&#xA;Guitar: Josh Klinghoffer (2009-present).&#xA;Bass: Michael Peter &quot;Flea&quot; Balzary (1983-present).&#xA;Drums: Chad Smith, (1988-present).&#xA;&#xA;Previous members:&#xA;&#xA;Notable guitarists (in chronological order):&#xA;Hillel Slovak (1983-1984),&#xA;Jack Sherman (1984),&#xA;Hillel Slovak (1985-1988),&#xA;John Frusciante (1988-1992), &#xA;Arik Marshall (1992-1993),&#xA;Jesse Tobias (1993)&#xA;Dave Navarro (1993-1998),&#xA;John Frusciante (1998-2008)&#xA;Notable drummers (in chronological order):&#xA;Jack Irons (1983-1984),&#xA;Cliff Martinez (1984-1987),&#xA;Jack Irons (1987-1988),&#xA;D.H. Peligro (1988),&#xA;Chad Smith, (1988-present)&#xA;&#xA;The Chili Peppers' original guitarist, Slovak, was replaced in 1984 by Jack Sherman, while Slovak and Irons recorded music with their band at the time, &quot;What Is This?&quot; Upon Slovak's return, Sherman was fired from the band. &#xA;&#xA;Following Slovak's death of a heroin overdose, a young John Frusciante took over as guitarist in 1988. Frusciante, however, quit the band in 1992 due in part to his sadness at the band becoming so successful in such a short time; complex personal issues, involving an addiction to heroin, were also a factor. He was then replaced by Arik Marshall. Approximately a year later, Marshall left the band, to be replaced by former Jane's Addiction guitarist Dave Navarro.&#xA;&#xA;After the release of 1995's One Hot Minute, Navarro's escalating drug habits became a subject of conflict. In 1998, Navarro was fired from the band, to be taken over by none other than former guitarist, Frusciante, who remained in the band until 2008, when he quietly took his leave on good terms with the other members.&#xA;&#xA;Founder and guitarist Hillel Slovak did not actually appear on the self-titled debut album, despite performing and writing the content with the band prior to recording. He was replaced by Jack Sherman for the recording of the album, but returned to the band for second album, Freaky Styley. The third album, Uplift Mofo Party Plan, is in fact the only album to include all four founding members. After this, Slovak overdosed on heroin and was replaced on future albums (Mother's Milk, Blood Sugar Sex Magik  - on which Frusciante provides guitars, One Hot Minute - Navarro,  Californication and By the Way - Frusciante) Frusciante is also on 2006's Stadium Arcadium.&#xA;&#xA;Frusciante has also been making solo albums for a number of years. His new album with the band Ataxia came out May 2007, and is titled Automatic Writing II.&#xA;&#xA;In 2003 Flea played bass on The Mars Volta's album Deloused In The Comatorium. Frusciante added guitar to tracks on Deloused and 2005's Frances The Mute. He also played rhythm guitar on The Mars Volta's Amputechture. Omar A. Rodriguez-Lopez, guitarist for The Mars Volta, appeared on Stadium Arcadium, playing the solo on &quot;Especially In Michigan&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;In 2011, the band released  I'm With You, their tenth studio album, and their first with guitarist Josh Klinghoffer.&#xA;&#xA;A new era in the band's history took place due Frusciante's departure in 2009. He was replaced by Josh Klinghoffer, who had already played shows as a second guitarist with the band during their 2007 tour dates.&#xA;   &#xA;User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL." index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/4734/thumb?t=1344380888" art="/library/metadata/4734/art?t=1344380888" addedAt="1344380420" updatedAt="1344380888">

The music Bryce Avary makes as The Rocket Summer is lush, explosively catchy and artful power pop that hints at a new Brian Wilson or Prince in the making. Keep an eye out on this one.” - AustinCityLimits.com&#xA;&#xA;Since launching his career as a 16-year-old with the independently released The Rocket Summer EP, a name he took from a Ray Bradbury short story, Bryce has toured around the world, selling out venues not just in the US, but Canada, the UK, Australia, and Japan, while playing such noted events as UK’s Glastonbury Festival, Scotland’s T in the Park, Japan’s Summer Sonic Festival, Australia’s Soundwave Festival, Austin City Limits, SXSW, Bamboozle, Cornerstone and the 2007 and 2010 Vans Warped Tour. “I try to write songs the whole world would want to sing along to but I also want to make an album of genuine and honest songs written from my heart that musically and lyrically are better than anything I have done before and above all will be an album that would hopefully move and affect people. For me it's all about focusing everything you have on making the greatest music you can without banking on anything else. I'm grateful to be doing this and I want to do this for the right reasons.&quot;  &#xA;&#xA;For someone as spiritually motivated as Avary, that means he focuses on the struggles and victories of life’s often-challenging journey in his most recent release on Island Def Jam Records titled Of Men and Angels as well as on the current album he is recording. Of Men and Angels was release in February 2010, and debuted as the No.1 Album on iTunes surpassing The Black Eyed Peas’ The E.N.D., which had previously held the No.1 spot for Top Album. The album debuted #38 on the Billboard 200 and # 4 on the Billboard Top Rock Albums charts. This is just one instance of how Avary’s loyal hardcore fan base has supported The Rocket Summer throughout the years. This also explains the kind of viral following that turned the video for “Do You Feel” into an Internet phenomenon. With guest appearances by Paramore, Relient K, All Time Low, Jack’s Mannequin, Forever the Sickest Kids, MxPx, Hellogoodbye, the music video led to the album version of the song being played more than 4 million times on The Rocket Summer’s My Space site. The album Do You Feel hit #44 on the Billboard 200 and #16 on the Billboard Top Rock Albums charts and has sold over 100,000 copies in the US alone. “We’re definitely aware of the kind of connection we have with our fans and I’m just fortunate to be a part of it.” &#xA;&#xA;His albums and live shows are all about positivity, optimism, sing-a-longs, excitement, and overcoming our struggles. The Rocket Summer has toured with The Goo Goo Dolls, OneRepublic, Paramore, Relient K, The All-American Rejects, Copeland, All Time Low, The Ataris, Something Corporate, Plain White T’s, Hellogoodbye, Phantom Planet &amp; many others. &#xA;&#xA;“I like the term ‘young veteran,’” says Avary. “We have this loyal, hardcore following and I couldn't be more grateful for this. I keep pushing myself forward, trying to make great records, trying to put on the best live performance I can, all the while expanding The Rocket Summer to as far as it can be taken.”&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Official website: http://www.therocketsummer.com/&#xA;   &#xA;User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL." index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/5339/thumb?t=1344380890" art="/library/metadata/5339/art?t=1344380890" addedAt="1344380485" updatedAt="1344380890">

			<Directory ratingKey="4931" key="/library/metadata/4931/children" type="artist" title="Savage Garden" summary="From Brisbane, Australia to worldwide success, Darren Hayes and Daniel Jones  were responsible for some of the most widely-known pop songs of the late '90s and early '00s. Appropriately enough, given their Anne Rice-inspired name, Savage Garden veered between lush ballads (Truly Madly Deeply, I knew I loved you) and up-tempo dance numbers (I Want You, The Animal Song) with a deftness that put many of their contemporaries in the shade. &#xA;&#xA;In July of 1996, under Roadshow Music, the duo released their debut single I Want You. The single was a hit in Australia and became the year's highest-selling by an Australian artist. The success of the single garnered much interest from many U.S. record labels and in September, Columbia Records won the bidding war to sign the band. In November a second single, To The Moon And Back, was released and was another chart hit—reaching No. 1 in January of the following year.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;‎I Want You&quot; was released in the United States in February 1997, where it peaked at No. 4 and quickly achieved gold status. Truly Madly Deeply, the band's third Australian single, was released in March and reached No. 1 just before &quot;I Want You&quot; was released across Europe in April. The duo’s debut album, Savage Garden, entered the Australian charts at No. 1 in March and remained at that peak for 17 weeks—it was released around the world two weeks later. At the end of May, “To The Moon And Back” became the most played song on U.S. radio.&#xA;&#xA;In June 1997, a fourth single, Break me, shake me was released in Australia as the band's debut album sat at No. 3 on the U.S. charts and was certified gold by the ARIA. By the end of August, the album was seven-times platinum in Australia, triple-platinum in Canada, and double-platinum in New Zealand and Singapore. At the end of August, Savage Garden received a record 13 ARIA awards nominations. The 10 ARIAs won by them in September was also a record, and one that still stands today. Riding this massive wave of popularity was the release of their fifth Australian single, Universe.  By November that year, &quot;Truly Madly Deeply&quot; became their third U.S. release, shooting up the charts to blow Elton John’s &quot;Candle In The Wind 1997&quot; out of its 14-week run at the number-one spot. By the end of 1997, Darren and Daniel had become international stars.&#xA;&#xA;In January 1998, All Around Me, a sixth single, was released just as the band kicked off their worldwide tour in Cairns, Australia. By the end of the year, &quot;Truly Madly Deeply&quot; was the most-played song on U.S. radio and the only one-sided single to spend a full year in the Top 30 of the Billboard Hot 100.&#xA;&#xA;The Animal Song (featured in the Disney film The Other Sister), the first single from the follow-up album Affirmation was released in February 1999 and became a hit in Australia and the US. That September saw the release of a new single previewing their forthcoming album; the smooth, romantic ballad, I knew I loved you.&#xA;&#xA;The duo's second album, Affirmation, was released in November 1999 globally. It took a month for it to go platinum in the US, largely due to the success of the single &quot;I Knew I Loved You,&quot; which hit #1 on the charts, eventually going platinum and becoming the most-played single on US radio for the year.&#xA;&#xA;Affirmation saw a new turn for Savage Garden; their looks had more similarities to that of mainstream pop and some of their new songs possessed a more adult contemporary sound.&#xA;&#xA;The group finished out the year by winning two Billboard Music Awards: Adult Contemporary Single of the Year and Hot 100 Singles Airplay of the Year.&#xA;&#xA;In February 2000, as Crash And Burn became the third single from their second album, 1997's &quot;Truly Madly Deeply&quot; was amazingly still on the Monitor/Billboard Adult Contemporary Airplay Chart, breaking the record for length of time of any single on that chart. It would finally drop off the chart after 123 weeks.&#xA;&#xA;In June, Darren Hayes performed O Sole Mio at Italian tenor Luciano Pavarotti's annual charitable benefit concert Pavarotti and Friends. Savage Garden's great success was reflected once again at the Billboard Music Awards, where they won Best Adult Contemporary Video and No. 1 Adult Contemporary Song of the Year, for &quot;I Knew I Loved You&quot;, and No. 1 Adult Contemporary Artist of the Year. &quot;I Knew I Loved You&quot; stayed on the Monitor/Billboard Adult Contemporary Airplay Chart for 124 weeks – overtaking the duo's own record previously set by &quot;Truly Madly Deeply&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;In October 2001, the band split and Darren Hayes went on to enjoy further success with albums Spin (2002),  The Tension And The Spark (2004) and This Delicate Thing We've Made (2007).&#xA;&#xA;As of 2005, the band’s debut album had been certified 12-times platinum in Australia, six-times platinum in the United States, and double-platinum in the United Kingdom.&#xA;   &#xA;User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL." index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/4931/thumb?t=1344380915" art="/library/metadata/4931/art?t=1344380915" addedAt="1344380443" updatedAt="1344380915">

We Are Pilots received a Grammy Award nomination on 6 December 2007 in the category of Best Electronic/Dance Album, but lost to The Chemical Brothers.&#xA;&#xA;The band's second studio album, Season Of Poison, was released on 4th November 2008, with Sisely Treasure as vocalist. They have released two singles from their second album: &quot;Ghost Town&quot; and &quot;Ricochet!&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;In 2009, Shiny Toy Guns released &quot;Major Tom&quot;, a Peter Schilling cover. &#xA;&#xA;In 2011, Carah Faye Charnow returned to Shiny Toy Guns. In addition, Charnow's husband, Daniel Johansson also joined the band on guitar, synth and bass. In March 2011, the band released a new single &quot;The Sun&quot;, available to download for free. &#xA;&#xA;In May 2012 the band announced that Daniel Johansson left the band.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Band Members:&#xA;Current members&#xA;Carah Faye Charnow – vocals, synth (2004–2008, 2011–present)&#xA;Gregori Chad Petree – vocals, guitar (2002–present)&#xA;Jeremy Dawson – synths, bass (2002–present)&#xA;Mikey Martin – drums (2004–present)&#xA;&#xA;Former members&#xA;Daniel Johansson – guitar, synth, bass (2011–2012)&#xA;Sisely Treasure – vocals (2008–2010)&#xA;Ursula Vari – vocals (2004)&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Official site: http://www.shinytoyguns.com&#xA;   &#xA;User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL." index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/4995/thumb?t=1344380940" art="/library/metadata/4995/art?t=1344380940" addedAt="1344380450" updatedAt="1344380940">

			<Directory ratingKey="5022" key="/library/metadata/5022/children" type="artist" title="Silverchair" summary="Silverchair is one of Australia’s most successful alternative rock (and formerly post-grunge) bands. The group has had more top twenty hits during the last decade than any other local artist and they have sold over six million albums worldwide.&#xA;&#xA;The band formed in 1992 in Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia. In 1994, at the age of 15, Silverchair got their big break when the band won a national competition called &quot;Pick Me&quot; with the demo of their song, &quot;Tomorrow&quot;. The demo became one of the most played songs in the history of the Australian station Triple J, and they played that year's Big Day Out as part of the prize for their win. &#xA;&#xA;Silverchair's earlier material is &quot;post-grunge&quot; and the huge influence of contemporaries such as Nirvana and Pearl Jam were incredibly obvious. Daniel Johns insists they have been inspired by bands such as Led Zeppelin and Deep Purple, however these claims are refuted by music fans and critics alike; for example,  prominent publications, such as Rolling Stone  and Guitar World were quoted as saying &quot;Silverchair's first two albums were radio-friendly, commercial derivatives of grunge music, which was popular at the time&quot;. Allmusic.com, while praising the overall sound of the first two albums (both received 4 stars out of 5) and stating &quot;for their age, their instrumental capabilities are quite impressive&quot;, describes them as &quot;concentrating too heavily on Pearl Jam and Nirvana&quot; and &quot;their songwriting abilities aren't as strong&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;From their third album (Neon Ballroom) onward, the band have tried to experiment with slightly more complex song structures, pop influences, and the usage of orchestral backing on a few songs, most notably on their fourth album Diorama with composer Van Dyke Parks contributing to three of the tracks. This change is shown on their performance in their only live album &quot;Live at Faraway Stables&quot; where the band plays two sets - the first comprising newer material where they are backed by two keyboardists to simulate orchestral arrangements, and the second containing their earlier material.&#xA;&#xA;2007 saw the release of the band's latest album Young Modern, featuring the lead single Straight Lines; the song reached number one on the ARIA singles charts. The album was supported by a full tour of North America (their first since 1999), and an extensive tour of Australia and New Zealand with fellow Aussie post-grunge rockers Powderfinger, entitled &quot;Across the Great Divide.&quot;&#xA;&#xA;To quote Daniel Johns, &quot;I've been thinking a lot since we finished [Young Modern] about where this fits into the other stuff we've done. The way I see it, the first album was naivete, the second one was anger, the third one was depression and the last one was escapism. Young Modern is all about acceptance.&quot; &#xA;&#xA;The band announced their split in 2011.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Members:&#xA;* Daniel Johns (vocals, guitar)&#xA;* Chris Joannou (bass)&#xA;* Ben Gillies (drums)&#xA;&#xA;Albums:&#xA;* Tomorrow (EP) (1994)&#xA;* Frogstomp (1995)&#xA;* Freak Show (1997)&#xA;* Neon Ballroom (1999)&#xA;* The Best Of - Volume One (2000)&#xA;* Diorama (2002)&#xA;* Rarities 1994-1999 (2002)&#xA;* Live From Faraway Stables (2CD &amp; DVD) (2003)&#xA;* Young Modern (2007)&#xA;   &#xA;User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL." index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/5022/thumb?t=1344380942" art="/library/metadata/5022/art?t=1344380942" addedAt="1344380453" updatedAt="1344380942">

She lived most of her life in New York City, attending the New York City High School of the Performing Arts (the school seen in the feature film musical Fame), where she studied modern dance.&#xA;&#xA;However, Vega realized that her talent in dance was not sufficient to make her living doing it. While attending Columbia studying English, she penned many songs and performed in college and community &quot;coffee houses&quot; inside and outside the New York City area.&#xA;&#xA;She was discovered in 1984, releasing her eponymous debut the following year. However, it was not until her sophomore effort, Solitude Standing, that Vega hit the big time.&#xA;&#xA;Vega has a prolific catalogue, and in 2003 she released a retrospective collection.

			<Directory ratingKey="5158" key="/library/metadata/5158/children" type="artist" title="Tenacious D" summary="Tenacious D (often referred to as &quot;The D&quot; and sometimes introduced as &quot;The Greatest Band in the world. Period.&quot;) is an American satirical rock duo formed by musicians and actors Kyle Gass and Jack Black in Los Angeles, California in 1994. Their music fuses vulgar absurdist comedy with rock music in a style that critics have described as &quot;mock rock&quot;. The band first gained reputation in 1999, starring in a self-titled HBO TV series. The drumming on both of their albums and the devils voice on the track Beelzeboss (also the one who plays Satan in The Pick of Destiny movie) was performed by Dave Grohl (of Nirvana, Foo Fighters,  Queens of the Stone Age, and Them Crooked Vultures fame). &#xA;&#xA;Tenacious D's music showcases Black's theatrical vocal delivery and Gass' acoustic guitar playing abilities. Their songs discuss the duo's purported musical and sexual prowess, as well as their friendship and cannabis usage. Their debut self-titled album features absurd and humorous sketches. Music critics have compared the storyteller-style lyrics of their songs to lyrics of rock opera. In addition, they have since recorded two albums, and starred in their own movie, Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny.&#xA;&#xA;Black and Gass, at the time respectively aged 16 and 24, met in Edinburgh, Scotland during the Edinburgh Fringe of 1989. Both were members of the Los Angeles-based theatre troupe, The Actors' Gang which was performing Tim Robbins and Adam Simon's play Carnage. Initially Black and Gass did not get on as Gass felt threatened by Black - as he was the main musician for the Actor's gang - but they eventually worked out their differences, and agreed to form a band. Gass taught Black to play guitar, in exchange for Black's helping him with his acting.&#xA;&#xA;Initially, Black and Kyle covered songs by Bobby McFerrin. Later they chose the name &quot;Tenacious D&quot; - a name derived from a term used by sports commentator Marv Albert about the tenacious defense of the NBA's New York Knicks - decided by the audience of the band's first live show, in 1994 at the now defunct Al's Bar. Other possibilities had included &quot;Pets or Meat&quot;, &quot;Balboa’s Biblical Theatre&quot; and &quot;The Axe Lords Featuring Gorgazon’s Mischief&quot;, which Gass described as being his personal favorite. In attendance was David Cross who later cast Tenacious D in his sketch comedy television series, Mr. Show.&#xA;&#xA;TV series:&#xA;&#xA;David Cross, with the writer Bob Odenkirk from Mr Show, continued his involvement with Tenacious D by producing three half-hour shows based on the band. The series, entitled Tenacious D, premiered in 1997, immediately following an episode of Mr. Show. While a total of three episodes consisting of two shorts, ten to twelve minutes in length, were produced, only the first was aired that year; the final two episodes did not air until the summer of 2000. The series was canceled after, according to Gass, HBO offered Tenacious D ten episodes, but in doing so, they would have to relinquish their role as executive producers. Gass and Black decided to make a movie instead. Many songs that eventually were included on the band's first album were first featured on the show, though the episodes also contain songs that remain unreleased.&#xA;&#xA;The six shorts were titled &quot;The Search for Inspirado&quot;, &quot;Angel in Disguise&quot;, &quot;Death of a Dream&quot;, &quot;The Greatest Song in the World&quot;, &quot;The Fan&quot;, and &quot;Road Gig&quot;. After the series aired, the band continued to perform. At a show at the Viper Room in Los Angeles, they met Dave Grohl, who remarked that he was impressed with their performance; this led to their cameo in the Foo Fighters' &quot;Learn to Fly&quot; music video. The popularity of Tenacious D further increased as they began to open for high profile acts, including Beck, Pearl Jam, and Foo Fighters.&#xA;&#xA;Lyrics and themes:&#xA; &#xA;The Devil CardSatire and comedy are a major aspect of Tenacious D's lyrical content. Gass said of their approach: &quot;I'd love to do the straight music thing, but that's kind of against our mission, which is to rebel against the serious singer-songwriter mentality.&quot; Their songs evoke heavy metal clichés of bands like Iron Maiden and Judas Priest. In particular, the song &quot;Dio&quot; pokes fun at the idea of a torch being passed &quot;Now it's time for him to pass the torch&quot; Songs like &quot;Friendship&quot; parody the lack of real friendship in rock groups with the lyric &quot;As long as there's a record deal, we'll always be friends&quot; Other songs cover the topic of sex; &quot;Kielbasa&quot; discusses anal sex, while &quot;Double Team&quot; boasts of the duos sexual prowess. Tenacious D also employs the technique of deliberate backmasking on &quot;Karate&quot;, a technique synonymous with bands like Slayer, who recorded a message in Hell Awaits.. The band's imagery also continues the theme of evil. The front cover of Tenacious D features Black and Gass standing naked below the Devil. Black described it as he and Gass being &quot;schooled by Satan&quot;. The pose is similar to that shown on the Devil tarot card. The Devil card signifies sexual desire, uncontrolled energy, vice and addiction.&#xA;&#xA;Tenacious D's music has been criticized for its frequent use of profanity. In addition, other critics have described the band as having exhausted the joke of &quot;cock rock&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;Influences:&#xA;&#xA;Black has said that the first song he enjoyed was ABBA's &quot;Take a Chance on Me&quot;. He attributes influences from Dio, Black Sabbath, Meat Loaf and Bobby McFerrin. Gass describes their influences as being derived from &quot;big dinosaurs of rock&quot; such as Led Zeppelin. In addition, Gass lists his influences as being Tom Waits, Tony Hawk and Tony Robbins. The band claimed that the inspiration for the song &quot;Tribute&quot; came after Black played Metallica's &quot;One&quot; for Gass, describing it as &quot;the best song in the world&quot;, leading to a failed attempt to themselves write an even better song.&#xA;&#xA;Gass has described Tenacious D's comic assertion that they are the best band as being &quot;ridiculous because it's a matter of opinion&quot;. Black characterizes Tenacious D's comic nature as an antidote to &quot;the masculinity of rock&quot;, adding &quot;There's also something funny about the macho-ness of rock. Like the bands that are the fucking hardest rocking are like, 'We'll fucking kick your ass, dude... with our rock.'&quot;&#xA;&#xA;Tenacious D is featured in the highly anticipated video game &quot;Guitar Hero III&quot;.  `The Metal' is prominently featured in the game's trailer released at E3 2007.&#xA;&#xA;Tenacious D also did backing vocals on the Styx song &quot;Kiss Your Ass Goodbye&quot;. It can be found on the album &quot;Cyclorama&quot; from 2003.&#xA;&#xA;They were included in Rock Band 2 with their song &quot;Master Exploder&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;In October of 2009 Jack Black starred as roadie Eddie Riggs in the open world video game Brütal Legend by Double Fine Productions on the XBOX 360 and Playstation 3.&#xA;   &#xA;User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL." index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/5158/thumb?t=1344380970" art="/library/metadata/5158/art?t=1344380970" addedAt="1344380466" updatedAt="1344380970">

			<Directory ratingKey="5383" key="/library/metadata/5383/children" type="artist" title="Tom Lehrer" summary="Thomas Andrew &quot;Tom&quot; Lehrer (born 9 April 1928) is an American singer-songwriter, satirist, pianist, and mathematician. He has lectured on mathematics and musical theater.&#xA;&#xA;Before attending college, Lehrer graduated from the Loomis Chaffee School in Windsor, Connecticut. As an undergraduate student at Harvard University, he began to write comic songs to entertain his friends, including Fight Fiercely, Harvard (1945). Those songs later became (in a joking reference to a leading scientific journal, The Physical Review) The Physical Revue. Influenced mainly by musical theater, his style consisted of parodying then-current forms of popular song. For example, his appreciation of list songs led him to set the names of the chemical elements to the tune of Gilbert and Sullivan's &quot;Major-General's Song&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;Inspired by the success of his performances of his songs, he paid for some studio time to record an album, Songs By Tom Lehrer, which he sold by mail order. Self-published and unpromoted, the album, which included the macabre (I Hold Your Hand in Mine), the mildly risqué (Be Prepared), and the mathematical (Lobachevsky), became a success via word of mouth. With a cult hit, he embarked on a series of concert tours and released a second album, which came in two versions: the songs were the same but More Songs by Tom Lehrer was studio-recorded, while An Evening Wasted With Tom Lehrer was recorded live in concert.&#xA;&#xA;Lehrer's major break into the United Kingdom came as a result of the citation accompanying an honorary degree given to Princess Margaret, where she cited musical tastes as &quot;catholic, ranging from Mozart to Tom Lehrer&quot;. This produced significant interest in his works, and helped secure distributors for his material. Ironically, it was in the UK where his music ended up more popular due to the proliferation of university newspapers referring to the material, and the willingness of the BBC to play his songs on the radio (something that was a rarity in the USA).&#xA;&#xA;By the early 1960s, Lehrer had retired from touring (which he intensely disliked) and was employed as the resident songwriter for the US edition of That Was The Week That Was (TW3), a satirical TV show. An increased proportion of his output became overtly political, or at least topical, on subjects such as pollution (Pollution), Vatican II (The Vatican Rag), race relations (National Brotherhood Week), education (New Math), American militarism (Send The Marines), World War III nostalgia (So Long, Mom, premiered by Steve Allen), and nuclear proliferation (Who's Next? and MLF Lullaby). He also wrote a song which satirized the alleged amorality of Wernher von Braun. A selection of these songs was released in the album That Was The Year That Was.&#xA;&#xA;The record deal with reprise records for the That Was The Year That Was album also gave Reprise distribution rights for Lehrer's earlier recordings, as Lehrer wanted to shut down his own Lehrer Records. The Reprise issue of Songs by Tom Lehrer was a stereo re-recording. This version was not issued on CD, but the songs were issued on the live Tom Lehrer Revisited on CD instead.&#xA;&#xA;There is an urban legend that Lehrer gave up political satire when the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Henry Kissinger in 1973. He did say that the awarding of the prize to Kissinger made political satire obsolete, but has denied that he stopped doing satire as a form of protest, and asserts that he had stopped doing satire several years earlier. Another urban legend held that he had been sued for libel by the subject of one of his songs, Wernher Von Braun, and been forced to relinquish all of his royalty income to Von Braun. However, Lehrer firmly denied this in an interview with the Sydney Morning Herald. (He had also mentioned Frank Fontaine and Jerry Lewis in &quot;National Brotherhood Week&quot;, in an uncomplimentary context, on the same album, but nothing resulted from that.)&#xA;&#xA;When asked about his reasons for abandoning his musical career, he cited a simple lack of interest, a distaste for touring, and boredom with performing the same songs repeatedly. He has observed that when he was moved to write and perform songs, he did; when he wasn't, he didn't, and after a while the latter situation prevailed. It has been frequently observed that, though many of Lehrer's songs satirized the Cold War political establishment of the day, that he stopped writing and performing just as the 1960s counterculture movement gained momentum. Lehrer has stated that he doubts his songs had an impact on those not already critical of the establishment: &quot;I don't think this kind of thing has an impact on the unconverted, frankly. It's not even preaching to the converted; it's titillating the converted... I'm fond of quoting Peter Cook, who talked about the satirical Berlin cabarets of the '30s, which did so much to stop the rise of Hitler and prevent the Second World War.&quot;&#xA;&#xA;Lehrer's musical career was notably brief, stating in an interview in the late 90s that he had performed a mere 109 shows, and written 37 songs across his 20-year career. Nevertheless, the cult following that had grown around his music significantly bolstered the effect that he had on a global scale.&#xA;&#xA;In the 1970s, Lehrer concentrated on teaching mathematics and musical theater, although he also wrote 10 songs for the children's television show The Electric Company. (Harvard schoolmate Joe Raposo was the show's musical director for its first three seasons.) In the early 1980s, Tom Foolery, a revival of his songs on the London stage, was a surprise hit. Although not its instigator, Lehrer eventually gave it his full support and updated several of his lyrics for the production.&#xA;&#xA;On 7 June and 8 June 1998, Tom Lehrer performed in public for the first time in 25 years at the Lyceum Theatre, London as part of the gala show Hey Mr Producer! celebrating the career of impresario Cameron Mackintosh (who had been the producer of Tom Foolery). The 8 June show has been his only performance before the Queen. Lehrer sang Poisoning Pigeons in the Park and an updated version of &quot;Who's Next&quot;. The DVD of the event includes the former song.&#xA;&#xA;In 2000, a CD box set, The Remains of Tom Lehrer, was released by Rhino Entertainment. It included live and studio versions of his first two albums, That Was The Year That Was, the songs he wrote for The Electric Company, and some previously unreleased material, accompanied by a small hardbound book containing an introduction by Dr. Demento and lyrics to all the songs.&#xA;&#xA;Lehrer celebrated his 80th birthday on April 9th 2008.&#xA;   &#xA;User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL." index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/5383/thumb?t=1344380955" addedAt="1344380490" updatedAt="1344380955">

It consists of two members, both vocalists: Anila Mirza and Amir El-Falaki. Anila was born October 8, 1974 in Hillerød, Denmark to a half-Pakistani, half-Persian mother, and an Indian father. Amir was born August 12, 1973 in Copenhagen, Denmark. In 1999, they had some success in the Scandinavian music charts with a bubblegum pop song from their album Fantastic, named &quot;Tarzan &amp; Jane&quot;. Toy-Box's first album, Fantastic, included the hits &quot;The Sailor Song&quot;, &quot;Best Friend&quot;, &quot;Super-Duper-Man&quot;, &quot;Teddy-Bear&quot; and &quot;Tarzan &amp; Jane&quot;. It was released in September 1999 and followed in 2001 by a second album, Toyride, which included fan-favorite songs &quot;Www.girl&quot;, &quot;Prince of Arabia&quot; and &quot;Wizard of Oz&quot;. The group has broken up. Amir is working as a dance teacher, music video choreographer and trainer to F.C. Copenhagen's cheerleading team. Anila changed her name to Aneela and began a solo career.&#xA;&#xA;(2) Toy Box (http://www.myspace.com/toyboxmusic) is a post-grunge alternative metal band from Ontario, Canada, formed in 2004 by Deriek Simon (lead vocals, guitars), Carmine Mallia (drums, percussion), and Duncan McIlroy (bass, vocals). After touring across Canada in 2004—including performances at Edgefest, sharing stages with Finger Eleven, Thornley, Idle Sons, Scratching Post, Swollen Members, Rascals, and Clarknova—Toy Box rolled into the Voodoo Records studios, Canada’s hottest independent label, to create a full length album. Their onstage energy is immediately addictive to anyone who has had the opportunity to catch a live performance. Likewise, this energy and massive sound has been captured in their debut album The Assasination Of... released in the fall of 2007. Beautifully crafted, poetic lyrics, razor sharp guitar riffs, groovy bass lines, beefy drum beats that would make John Bonham proud. This has been contrasted with string and piano arrangements delicately placed throughout to form a dramatic backdrop for vocals so powerful and intense your brain begs for more.&#xA;&#xA;(3) Toybox (http://www.myspace.com/toyboxband) is also a UK glam-rock band, based in Northampton and Brighton, consisting of Alice Acidosis, Cinderella Swallows, Roberta Rim Job, and Nurse KKK.&#xA;&#xA;(4) Toybox (http://www.myspace.com/toybx) is a US rock band based in Tempe, Arizona, consisting of Yohei (Vocals, Bass), Naoto (Guitar, Vocals), and Celica (Drums).  To date, they have released one EP called &quot;Five Seconds To...&quot; and a full length album titled &quot;Stay Alive&quot;. Both can be found on iTunes.

The band was started by bassist and songwriter Dominic Davi, who enlisted Kristin McRory as Tsunami Bomb's original vocalist. Davi met McRory in late 1997, when she joined the band Headboard on vocals.&#xA;&#xA;In 2003 their song Invasion From Within' was featured in the American and European versions of the video game Disgaea developed by Nippon Ichi on the PS2.&#xA;&#xA;Tsunami Bomb's original lineup consisted of 5 people, including a keyboard player named Oobliette Sparks who also contributed vocals (and remained with the band until 2001). Gabriel Lindeman played drums for the band's first few shows, but he did not join the band full-time until 1999.

Mike Griffen, their guitarist since 2000, left the band in 2004 and was replaced by Jay Northington.&#xA;&#xA;Their last releases as a band included their final album as Tsunami Bomb entitled, &quot;The Definitive Act&quot; 2004 and a live concert DVD entitled, &quot;Live at the Glasshouse&quot;, in the The Show Must Go Off live music DVD in 2005 both on Kung Fu Records.&#xA;&#xA;In late 2005, after years of touring and numerous line up changes Tsunami Bomb officially broke up, citing problems with the &quot;business end of the music industry&quot;&#xA;&#xA;Discography&#xA;B-Movie Queens (1999)&#xA;Mayhem on the High Seas (1999)&#xA;The Invasion from Within (2000)&#xA;The Ultimate Escape (2002)&#xA;The Definitive Act (2004)&#xA;   &#xA;User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL." index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/5430/thumb?t=1344380962" addedAt="1344380495" updatedAt="1344380962">

			<Directory ratingKey="5707" key="/library/metadata/5707/children" type="artist" title="We Are Scientists" summary="We Are Scientists is an American indie rock band featuring Keith Murray (guitar and lead vocals), Chris Cain (bass guitar and backing vocals), Max Hart (keys and guitar) and Andy Burrows (drums). Co-founder Michael Tapper (drums and backing vocals) left the band in 2007 and is currently a member of the bands Bishop Allen and Fool's Gold. They formed in 2000 in Claremont, California, United States.&#xA;&#xA;Their name was inspired by an awkward conversation with a U-Haul employee who was inspecting a van that the band had rented. The U-haul employee, attempting to make polite conversation, asked the three bespectacled band members if they were brothers. They said no. He asked if they were scientists, as they looked like they could be the kind of people who wear lab coats. They told him that they were musicians, not scientists. To this day, they regret telling the truth. They are not  named after the Cap'n Jazz song which bears the name.&#xA;&#xA;The band formed while its members attended the Claremont Colleges. Murray and Cain attended Pomona College; Michael Tapper attended Harvey Mudd College.&#xA;&#xA;The band has released three self-made EPs (Bitching!, Safety, Fun, and Learning (In That Order) and In Action). Their debut LP, With Love And Squalor was on Virgin Records, the first three singles of which were &quot;Nobody Move, Nobody Get Hurt&quot;, &quot;The Great Escape&quot; and &quot;It's A Hit&quot;. The album takes its name from the J.D. Salinger short story &quot;For Esme - With Love and Squalor&quot;. They have since released LP Crap Attack, which is a collection of B-Sides, covers and other rarities, and their full follow-up album, Brain Thrust Mastery which debuted in the UK on March 17,2008 reached number 11 at the UK Album charts.&#xA;&#xA;On the 1st November 2007, NME reported that Michael Tapper has left We Are Scientists under amicable circumstances, and on September 18, 2007, the band announced on their website that Max Hart, a keyboardist and guitarist who has played live with them before, has joined the band temporarily. As they put it: &quot;There's no easy answer as to how long Max will stick around. Maybe we'll grow to hate his sanctimonious ways, which for now tickle us so. Maybe he'll grow to hate our open-minded, funny, refreshing, handsome ways, thus achieving what psychologists and bookies long ago labeled impossible.&quot;&#xA;&#xA;And to make things even more exciting for the band, We Are Scientists is featured in the soundtrack of the 2008 film Nick &amp; Norah's Infinite Playlist, which Bishop Allen - at the time featuring former We Are Scientists drummer Michael Tapper - appears in a cameo.&#xA;&#xA;According to Keith Murray's Wikipedia he was nominated for World's Sexiest Vegetarian 2007 and is predicted that he will be the new face of Louis Vuitton's spring/summer '09 collection. &#xA;&#xA;The Band's 3rd effort, Barbara, was released in June of 2010 and features ex-Razorlight drummer Andy Burrows.&#xA;   &#xA;User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL." index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/5707/thumb?t=1344380981" art="/library/metadata/5707/art?t=1344380981" addedAt="1344380521" updatedAt="1344380981">

Every thing they hear, touch and see influences them. The White Tie Affair is an adventure into pop, exploring many different styles and sounds. Whether it be sung, strummed, or programmed, you can bet they have tried to make it work. Front man Chris Wallace explains that the goal of the band is to &quot;communicate their love for different kinds of music to anyone who wants to listen.&quot;&#xA;&#xA;Growing up in Chicago, the group started piecing together sounds - everything from Stevie Wonder to AFI to The Police and came up with original, catchy songs. The White Tie Affair finally unveiled their musical work, playing shows all over Chicago. Their home city continues to greet them with open arms as the band has sold out the Beat Kitchen and has been main support for Lucky Boys Confusion at the annual reunion show at the Metro.&#xA;&#xA;It only took a couple of months before Slightly Dangerous/Epic Records took notice and the band signed a deal in 2007. Since then, The White Tie Affair has toured extensively across the country, playing over 250 shows, garnering press and die-hard fans alike. &quot;We are living the life we always heard rock bands talk about when they were starting out É the band in a van, playing great venues in a different town every night,&quot; says guitarist Sean P. &quot;This is the life we always wanted.&quot;&#xA;&#xA;The White Tie Affair's debut album Walk This Way, released on April 22, is a soundtrack for the iTunes, PlayStation generation with breakout songs such as &quot;Allow Me to Introduce Myself, Mr. Right,&quot; &quot;Candle (Sick and Tired)&quot; and &quot;Take it Home.&quot; &quot;Candle (Sick and Tired) debuted on the pop chart at number 37 and was featured on MTV's The City.&#xA;&#xA;The White Tie Affair have also forged a partnership with Playboy Enterprises. After playing the Playboy Pajama Party in summer 2008, The White Tie Affair were photographed by Mick Rock for the November 2008 &quot;Fashion&quot; issue of Playboy Magazine, played a number of Playboy's Vegas parties, and are headlined Playboy's College Tour.&#xA;&#xA;MTV has said, &quot;since we first started listening to them, The White Tie Affair went from small-time gigs to big-time tours and from YouTube stars to TRL heroes. And they've gracefully braved grandiose comparisons to hometown heroes Fall Out Boy (though the Killers come to mind, and Boys Like Girls fans, you also need to pay attention), though they're carving out their own niche with glammed-up, synthed-out dance-rock tracks like &quot;Candle (Sick and Tired)&quot; and &quot;Allow Me to Introduce Myself, Mr. Right&quot; faster than you can swill champagne out of the bottle.&quot;&#xA;&#xA;The White Tie Affair have garnered a huge fan base in a short period of time and continue to impress. Their video for &quot;Candle (Sick and Tired) premiered on MySpace with 100,000 views in less than 3 days, they are embarking on a US tour with Lady Gaga, and are one of Warped Tour Kevin Lyman's favorite bands for this summer's Vans Warped Tour.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;At the end of the day, if our music makes you smile or dance or sing in some way, then we are accomplishing our goals. We want be the soundtrack to your great days.&quot; - Chris Wallace &#xA;&#xA;http://www.myspace.com/thewhitetieaffair&#xA;   &#xA;User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL." index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/5371/thumb?t=1344380970" addedAt="1344380488" updatedAt="1344380970">

			<Directory ratingKey="5828" key="/library/metadata/5828/children" type="artist" title="YUI" summary="Yoshioka Yui (吉岡唯; known/stylized as YUI (ユイ?)) (born March 26, 1987 in Fukuoka, Japan), is a japanese singer-songwriter and actress. She sings and plays acoustic guitar, and writes her own songs, and apart from playing acoustic guitar, she also likes watching movies, reading books, and playing badminton. Her third single &quot;LIFE&quot; was the fifth ending theme for BLEACH, a popular Japanese anime series, which has brought her some international fame.&#xA;&#xA;YUI began writing poems in ninth grade. At the age of 16, by recommendation of a friend, she began studying song, songwriting, and guitar at a private music school in her native Fukuoka. Aspiring to become professional, she carried her guitar around and sang at local places such as the seashore of Shingu and in the middle of the rice fields of Kaminofu.&#xA;&#xA;In March 2003, at an audition hosted by Sony Music Japan, all judges evaluated her with the highest score, which caused a fierce scramble among labels. At this audition, she sang three songs - her first song &quot;Why me&quot;, which was later coupled with her debut single, as well as &quot;It's happy line&quot; and &quot;I know&quot;, which were included on her indie single - as opposed to the audition rule that a participant could only sing two songs. Sitting cross-legged on the floor, she strummed her guitar and sang. The judges and the others present claimed that &quot;the performance created a tremendous aura from her heavenly voice, and captured the hearts of the whole audience&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;Upon leaving her home of Fukuoka for Tokyo, YUI wrote the song &quot;feel my soul&quot;. She was planning release on an indie label as a tribute to her hometown, when the song caught the ears of Fuji TV producer, Mr. Yamaguchi, who happened to see the demo video clip. He claimed YUI's voice haunted him so much that he went out of his way to visit the recording studio himself. He even made his channel's prime-time drama an extraordinary tie-in with YUI's debut track.&#xA;&#xA;Although she is not the most comfortable when it comes to talking to people, she enjoys communicating with her audience at street performances in the Tenjin district of Fukuoka.&#xA;&#xA;Her fifth single is &quot;Good-bye days&quot;, which was also the theme for the film &quot;Taiyou no Uta&quot; (&quot;Midnight Sun&quot;). YUI took a role of a leading actress herself. The artist usually listed as singing &quot;Good-bye days&quot; is YUI for 雨音薫 (YUI for Kaoru Amane).&#xA;&#xA;YUI's seventh single, &quot;Rolling star&quot;, is the fifth opening theme of BLEACH. Selling almost 150,000 copies, it is YUI's second highest selling single to date (first being &quot;Good-bye days&quot; with over 200,000 copies.)&#xA;&#xA;More info http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yui_(singer)&#xA;&#xA;Official site: www.YUI-net.com&#xA;   &#xA;User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL." index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/5828/thumb?t=1344380996" addedAt="1344380533" updatedAt="1344380996">
